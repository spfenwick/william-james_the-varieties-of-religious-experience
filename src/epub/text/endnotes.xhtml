						<p>As with many ideas that float in the air of one’s time, this notion shrinks from dogmatic general statement and expresses itself only partially and by innuendo. It seems to me that few conceptions are less instructive than this reinterpretation of religion as perverted sexuality. It reminds one, so crudely is it often employed, of the famous Catholic taunt, that the Reformation may be best understood by remembering that its <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la">fons et origo</span> was Luther’s wish to marry a nun:⁠—the effects are infinitely wider than the alleged causes, and for the most part opposite in nature. It is true that in the vast collection of religious phenomena, some are undisguisedly amatory⁠—<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr>, sex-deities and obscene rites in polytheism, and ecstatic feelings of union with the Saviour in a few Christian mystics. But then why not equally call religion an aberration of the digestive function, and prove one’s point by the worship of Bacchus and Ceres, or by the ecstatic feelings of some other saints about the Eucharist? Religious language clothes itself in such poor symbols as our life affords, and the whole organism gives overtones of comment whenever the mind is strongly stirred to expression. Language drawn from eating and drinking is probably as common in religious literature as is language drawn from the sexual life. We <span class="tei tei-q">“hunger and thirst”</span> after righteousness; we <span class="tei tei-q">“find the Lord a sweet savor;”</span> we <span class="tei tei-q">“taste and see that he is good.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Spiritual milk for American babes, drawn from the breasts of both testaments,”</span> is a subtitle of the once famous New England Primer, and Christian devotional literature indeed quite floats in milk, thought of from the point of view, not of the mother, but of the greedy babe.</p>
						<p>Saint François de Sales, for instance, thus describes the <span class="tei tei-q">“orison of quietude”</span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“In this state the soul is like a little child still at the breast, whose mother, to caress him whilst he is still in her arms, makes her milk distill into his mouth without his even moving his lips. So it is here.⁠ ⁠… Our Lord desires that our will should be satisfied with sucking the milk which His Majesty pours into our mouth, and that we should relish the sweetness without even knowing that it cometh from the Lord.”</span> And again: <span class="tei tei-q">“Consider the little infants, united and joined to the breasts of their nursing mothers, you will see that from time to time they press themselves closer by little starts to which the pleasure of sucking prompts them. Even so, during its orison, the heart united to its God oftentimes makes attempts at closer union by movements during which it presses closer upon the divine sweetness.”</span> Chemin de la Perfection, ch. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">xxxi</span>.; Amour de Dieu, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">vii</span>. ch. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">i</span>.</p>
						<p>In fact, one might almost as well interpret religion as a perversion of the respiratory function. The Bible is full of the language of respiratory oppression: <span class="tei tei-q">“Hide not thine ear at my breathing; my groaning is not hid from thee; my heart panteth, my strength faileth me; my bones are hot with my roaring all the night long; as the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so my soul panteth after thee, O my God.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi">God’s Breath in Man</span> is the title of the chief work of our best known American mystic (Thomas Lake Harris); and in certain non-Christian countries the foundation of all religious discipline consists in regulation of the inspiration and expiration.</p>
						<p>These arguments are as good as much of the reasoning one hears in favor of the sexual theory. But the champions of the latter will then say that their chief argument has no analogue elsewhere. The two main phenomena of religion, namely, melancholy and conversion, they will say, are essentially phenomena of adolescence, and therefore synchronous with the development of sexual life. To which the retort again is easy. Even were the asserted synchrony unrestrictedly true as a fact (which it is not), it is not only the sexual life, but the entire higher mental life which awakens during adolescence. One might then as well set up the thesis that the interest in mechanics, physics, chemistry, logic, philosophy, and sociology, which springs up during adolescent years along with that in poetry and religion, is also a perversion of the sexual instinct:⁠—but that would be too absurd. Moreover, if the argument from synchrony is to decide, what is to be done with the fact that the religious age <span class="tei tei-foreign">par excellence</span> would seem to be old age, when the uproar of the sexual life is past?</p>
						<p>The plain truth is that to interpret religion one must in the end look at the immediate content of the religious consciousness. The moment one does this, one sees how wholly disconnected it is in the main from the content of the sexual consciousness. Everything about the two things differs, objects, moods, faculties concerned, and acts impelled to. Any <em class="tei tei-emph">general</em> assimilation is simply impossible: what we find most often is complete hostility and contrast. If now the defenders of the sex-theory say that this makes no difference to their thesis; that without the chemical contributions which the sex-organs make to the blood, the brain would not be nourished so as to carry on religious activities, this final proposition may be true or not true; but at any rate it has become profoundly uninstructive: we can deduce no consequences from it which help us to interpret religion’s meaning or value. In this sense the religious life depends just as much upon the spleen, the pancreas, and the kidneys as on the sexual apparatus, and the whole theory has lost its point in evaporating into a vague general assertion of the dependence, <em class="tei tei-emph">somehow</em>, of the mind upon the body.</p>

						<p><span class="tei tei-q">“I know not to what physical laws philosophers will some day refer the feelings of melancholy.

This critic, after a wide study of the facts, concludes that the cures by mind-cure exist, but are in no respect different from those now officially recognized in medicine as cures by suggestion; and the end of his essay contains an interesting physiological speculation as to the way in which the suggestive ideas may work (<abbr>p.</abbr> 67 of the reprint). As regards the general phenomenon of mental cure itself, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Goddard writes: <span class="tei tei-q">“In spite of the severe criticism we have made of reports of cure, there still remains a vast amount of material, showing a powerful influence of the mind in disease. Many cases are of diseases that have been diagnosed and treated by the best physicians of the country, or which prominent hospitals have tried their hand at curing, but without success. People of culture and education have been treated by this method with satisfactory results. Diseases of long standing have been ameliorated, and even cured.⁠ ⁠… We have traced the mental element through primitive medicine and folk-medicine of today, patent medicine, and witchcraft. We are convinced that it is impossible to account for the existence of these practices, if they did not cure disease, and that if they cured disease, it must have been the mental element that was effective. The same argument applies to those modern schools of mental therapeutics⁠—Divine Healing and Christian Science. It is hardly conceivable that the large body of intelligent people who comprise the body known distinctively as Mental Scientists should continue to exist if the whole thing were a delusion. It is not a thing of a day; it is not confined to a few; it is not local. It is true that many failures are recorded, but that only adds to the argument. There must be many and striking successes to counterbalance the failures, otherwise the failures would have ended the delusion.⁠ ⁠… Christian Science, Divine Healing, or Mental Science do not, and never can in the very nature of things, cure all diseases; nevertheless, the practical applications of the general principles of the broadest mental science will tend to prevent disease.⁠ ⁠… We do find sufficient evidence to convince us that the proper reform in mental attitude would relieve many a sufferer of ills that the ordinary physician cannot touch; would even delay the approach of death to many a victim beyond the power of absolute cure, and the faithful adherence to a truer philosophy of life will keep many a man well, and give the doctor time to devote to alleviating ills that are unpreventable”</span> (<abbr>pp.</abbr> 33, 34 of reprint).<a href="#noteref_46" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Thus to the wretched, sick, and poor did he address himself, but not as a moralist, and without a trace of sentimentalism. He never makes groups and departments of the ills; he never spends time in asking whether the sick one <span class="tei tei-q">‘deserves’</span> to be cured; and it never occurs to him to sympathize with the pain or the death. He nowhere says that sickness is a beneficent infliction, and that evil has a healthy use. No, he calls sickness sickness and health health. All evil, all wretchedness, is for him something dreadful; it is of the great kingdom of Satan; but he feels the power of the Saviour within him. He knows that advance is possible only when weakness is overcome, when sickness is made well.”</span> Das Wesen des Christenthums, 1900, <abbr>p.</abbr> 39.<a href="#noteref_50" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

						<p>The Cairds, for example. In <span class="tei tei-hi">Edward Caird’s</span> Glasgow Lectures of 1890⁠–⁠92 passages like this abound:⁠—</p>
						<p><span class="tei tei-q">“The declaration made in the beginning of the ministry of Jesus that <span class="tei tei-q">‘the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of heaven is at hand,’</span> passes with scarce a break into the announcement that <span class="tei tei-q">‘the kingdom of God is among you’</span>; and the importance of this announcement is asserted to be such that it makes, so to speak, a difference <em class="tei tei-emph">in kind</em> between the greatest saints and prophets who lived under the previous reign of division, and <span class="tei tei-q">‘the least in the kingdom of heaven.’</span> The highest ideal is brought close to men and declared to be within their reach, they are called on to be <span class="tei tei-q">‘perfect as their Father in heaven is perfect.’</span> The sense of alienation and distance from God which had grown upon the pious in Israel just in proportion as they had learned to look upon Him as no mere national divinity, but as a God of justice who would punish Israel for its sin as certainly as Edom or Moab, is declared to be no longer in place; and the typical form of Christian prayer points to the abolition of the contrast between this world and the next which through all the history of the Jews had continually been growing wider: <span class="tei tei-q">‘As in heaven, so on earth.’</span> The sense of the division of man from God, as a finite being from the Infinite, as weak and sinful from the Omnipotent Goodness, is not indeed lost; but it can no longer overpower the consciousness of oneness. The terms <span class="tei tei-q">‘Son’</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">‘Father’</span> at once state the opposition and mark its limit. They show that it is not an absolute opposition, but one which presupposes an indestructible principle of unity, that can and must become a principle of reconciliation.”</span> The Evolution of Religion, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">ii</span>. <abbr>pp.</abbr> 146, 147.</p>

					<p>The theistic explanation is by divine grace, which creates a new nature within one the moment the old nature is sincerely given up.

						<p>Within the churches a disposition has always prevailed to regard sickness as a visitation; something sent by God for our good, either as chastisement, as warning, or as opportunity for exercising virtue, and, in the Catholic Church, of earning <span class="tei tei-q">“merit.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Illness,”</span> says a good Catholic writer (<span class="tei tei-hi">P. Lejeune</span>: Introd. à la Vie Mystique, 1899, <abbr>p.</abbr> 218), <span class="tei tei-q">“is the most excellent of corporeal mortifications, the mortification which one has not one’s self chosen, which is imposed directly by God, and is the direct expression of his will. <span class="tei tei-q">‘If other mortifications are of silver,’</span> Mgr. Gay says, <span class="tei tei-q">‘this one is of gold; since although it comes of ourselves, coming as it does of original sin, still on its greater side, as coming (like all that happens) from the providence of God, it is of divine manufacture. And how just are its blows! And how efficacious it is!⁠ ⁠… I do not hesitate to say that patience in a long illness is mortification’s very masterpiece, and consequently the triumph of mortified souls.’</span> ”</span> According to this view, disease should in any case be submissively accepted, and it might under certain circumstances even be blasphemous to wish it away.</p>
						<p>Of course there have been exceptions to this, and cures by special miracle have at all times been recognized within the church’s pale, almost all the great saints having more or less performed them. It was one of the heresies of Edward Irving, to maintain them still to be possible. An extremely pure faculty of healing after confession and conversion on the patient’s part, and prayer on the priest’s, was quite spontaneously developed in the German pastor, Joh. Christoph Blumhardt, in the early forties and exerted during nearly thirty years. Blumhardt’s Life by Zündel (5th edition, Zurich, 1887) gives in chapters <span epub:type="z3998:roman">ix</span>., <span epub:type="z3998:roman">x</span>., <span epub:type="z3998:roman">xi</span>., and <span epub:type="z3998:roman">xvii</span>. a pretty full account of his healing activity, which he invariably ascribed to direct divine interposition. Blumhardt was a singularly pure, simple, and non-fanatical character, and in this part of his work followed no previous model. In Chicago today we have the case of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> J. A. Dowie, a Scottish Baptist preacher, whose weekly <span class="tei tei-q">“Leaves of Healing”</span> were in the year of grace 1900 in their sixth volume, and who, although he denounces the cures wrought in other sects as <span class="tei tei-q">“diabolical counterfeits”</span> of his own exclusively <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine Healing,”</span> must on the whole be counted into the mind-cure movement. In mind-cure circles the fundamental article of faith is that disease should never be accepted. It is wholly of the pit. God wants us to be absolutely healthy, and we should not tolerate ourselves on any lower terms.</p>

						<p>The difference between Greek pessimism and the oriental and modern variety is that the Greeks had not made the discovery that the pathetic mood may be idealized, and figure as a higher form of sensibility. Their spirit was still too essentially masculine for pessimism to be elaborated or lengthily dwelt on in their classic literature. They would have despised a life set wholly in a minor key, and summoned it to keep within the proper bounds of lachrymosity. The discovery that the enduring emphasis, so far as this world goes, may be laid on its pain and failure, was reserved for races more complex, and (so to speak) more feminine than the Hellenes had attained to being in the classic period. But all the same was the outlook of those Hellenes blackly pessimistic.</p>

Before I had quite recovered, I heard told a story of a brute who had kicked his wife downstairs, and then continued the operation until she became insensible. I felt the horror of the thing keenly. Instantly this thought flashed through my mind: <span class="tei tei-q">‘I have no use for a God who permits such things.’</span> This experience was followed by months of stoical indifference to the God of my previous life, mingled with feelings of positive dislike and a somewhat proud defiance of him. I still thought there might be a God. If so he would probably damn me, but I should have to stand it. I felt very little fear and no desire to propitiate him. I have never had any personal relations with him since this painful experience.”</span>

						<p>The second case exemplifies how small an additional stimulus will overthrow the mind into a new state of equilibrium when the process of preparation and incubation has proceeded far enough. It is like the proverbial last straw added to the camel’s burden, or that touch of a needle which makes the salt in a supersaturated fluid suddenly begin to crystallize out.</p>
						<p>Tolstoy writes: <span class="tei tei-q">“S., a frank and intelligent man, told me as follows how he ceased to believe:⁠—</span></p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“He was twenty-six years old when one day on a hunting expedition, the time for sleep having come, he set himself to pray according to the custom he had held from childhood.</span>
						</p>
						<p><span class="tei tei-q">“His brother, who was hunting with him, lay upon the hay and looked at him. When S. had finished his prayer and was turning to sleep, the brother said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Do you still keep up that thing?’</span> Nothing more was said. But since that day, now more than thirty years ago, S. has never prayed again; he never takes communion, and does not go to church. All this, not because he became acquainted with convictions of his brother which he then and there adopted; not because he made any new resolution in his soul, but merely because the words spoken by his brother were like the light push of a finger against a leaning wall already about to tumble by its own weight. These words but showed him that the place wherein he supposed religion dwelt in him had long been empty, and that the sentences he uttered, the crosses and bows which he made during his prayer, were actions with no inner sense. Having once seized their absurdity, he could no longer keep them up.”</span> My Confession, <abbr>p.</abbr> 8.</p>

						<p>I subjoin an additional document which has come into my possession, and which represents in a vivid way what is probably a very frequent sort of conversion, if the opposite of <span class="tei tei-q">“falling in love,”</span> falling out of love, may be so termed. Falling in love also conforms frequently to this type, a latent process of unconscious preparation often preceding a sudden awakening to the fact that the mischief is irretrievably done. The free and easy tone in this narrative gives it a sincerity that speaks for itself.</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“For two years of this time I went through a very bad experience, which almost drove me mad. I had fallen violently in love with a girl who, young as she was, had a spirit of coquetry like a cat. As I look back on her now, I hate her, and wonder how I could ever have fallen so low as to be worked upon to such an extent by her attractions. Nevertheless, I fell into a regular fever, could think of nothing else; whenever I was alone, I pictured her attractions, and spent most of the time when I should have been working, in recalling our previous interviews, and imagining future conversations. She was very pretty, good humored, and jolly to the last degree, and intensely pleased with my admiration. Would give me no decided answer yes or no, and the queer thing about it was that whilst pursuing her for her hand, I secretly knew all along that she was unfit to be a wife for me, and that she never would say yes. Although for a year we took our meals at the same boardinghouse, so that I saw her continually and familiarly, our closer relations had to be largely on the sly, and this fact, together with my jealousy of another one of her male admirers, and my own conscience despising me for my uncontrollable weakness, made me so nervous and sleepless that I really thought I should become insane. I understand well those young men murdering their sweethearts, which appear so often in the papers. Nevertheless I did love her passionately, and in some ways she did deserve it.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“The queer thing was the sudden and unexpected way in which it all stopped. I was going to my work after breakfast one morning, thinking as usual of her and of my misery, when, just as if some outside power laid hold of me, I found myself turning round and almost running to my room, where I immediately got out all the relics of her which I possessed, including some hair, all her notes and letters, and ambrotypes on glass. The former I made a fire of, the latter I actually crushed beneath my heel, in a sort of fierce joy of revenge and punishment. I now loathed and despised her altogether, and as for myself I felt as if a load of disease had suddenly been removed from me. That was the end. I never spoke to her or wrote to her again in all the subsequent years, and I have never had a single moment of loving thought towards one who for so many months entirely filled my heart. In fact, I have always rather hated her memory, though now I can see that I had gone unnecessarily far in that direction. At any rate, from that happy morning onward I regained possession of my own proper soul, and have never since fallen into any similar trap.”</span>
						</p>
						<p>This seems to me an unusually clear example of two different levels of personality, inconsistent in their dictates, yet so well balanced against each other as for a long time to fill the life with discord and dissatisfaction. At last, not gradually, but in a sudden crisis, the unstable equilibrium is resolved, and this happens so unexpectedly that it is as if, to use the writer’s words, <span class="tei tei-q">“some outside power laid hold.”</span></p>
						<p>Professor Starbuck gives an analogous case, and a converse case of hatred suddenly turning into love, in his Psychology of Religion, <abbr>p.</abbr> 141. Compare the other highly curious instances which he gives on <abbr>pp.</abbr> 137⁠–⁠144, of sudden non-religious alterations of habit or character. He seems right in conceiving all such sudden changes as results of special cerebral functions unconsciously developing until they are ready to play a controlling part, when they make irruption into the conscious life. When we treat of sudden <span class="tei tei-q">“conversion,”</span> I shall make as much use as I can of this hypothesis of subconscious incubation.</p>

I know very well how they proceed as to this matter, for I have had frequent opportunities of observing their conduct. Very often their experience at first appears like a confused chaos, but then those parts are selected which bear the nearest resemblance to such particular steps as are insisted on; and these are dwelt upon in their thoughts, and spoken of from time to time, till they grow more and more conspicuous in their view, and other parts which are neglected grow more and more obscure. Thus what they have experienced is insensibly strained, so as to bring it to an exact conformity to the scheme already established in their minds.

					<p>For instance, C. G. Finney italicizes the volitional element: <span class="tei tei-q">“Just at this point the whole question of Gospel salvation opened to my mind in a manner most marvelous to me at the time. I think I then saw, as clearly as I ever have in my life, the reality and fullness of the atonement of Christ.

The thought was pressing me, of the rashness of my promise that I would give my heart to God that day, or die in the attempt. It seemed to me as if that was binding on my soul; and yet I was going to break my vow. A great sinking and discouragement came over me, and I felt almost too weak to stand upon my knees. Just at this moment I again thought I heard some one approach me, and I opened my eyes to see whether it were so. But right there the revelation of my pride of heart, as the great difficulty that stood in the way, was distinctly shown to me. An overwhelming sense of my wickedness in being ashamed to have a human being see me on my knees before God took such powerful possession of me, that I <em class="tei tei-emph">cried at the top of my voice, and exclaimed that I would not leave that place if all the men on earth and all the devils in hell surrounded me</em>. <span class="tei tei-q">‘What!’</span> I said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘such a degraded sinner as I am, on my knees confessing my sins to the great and holy God; and ashamed to have any human being, and a sinner like myself, find me on my knees endeavoring to make my peace with my offended God!’</span> The sin appeared awful, infinite.

					<p>The reader will here please notice that in my exclusive reliance in the last lecture on the subconscious <span class="tei tei-q">“incubation”</span> of motives deposited by a growing experience, I followed the method of employing accepted principles of explanation as far as one can. The subliminal region, whatever else it may be, is at any rate a place now admitted by psychologists to exist for the accumulation of vestiges of sensible experience (whether inattentively or attentively registered), and for their elaboration according to ordinary psychological or logical laws into results that end by attaining such a <span class="tei tei-q">“tension”</span> that they may at times enter consciousness with something like a burst. It thus is <span class="tei tei-q">“scientific”</span> to interpret all otherwise unaccountable invasive alterations of consciousness as results of the tension of subliminal memories reaching the bursting-point. But candor obliges me to confess that there are occasional bursts into consciousness of results of which it is not easy to demonstrate any prolonged subconscious incubation. Some of the cases I used to illustrate the sense of presence of the unseen in Lecture <a class="pginternal tei tei-ref" href="#Lecture_III">III</a> were of this order (compare pages <a class="pginternal tei tei-ref" href="#Pg059">59</a>, <a class="pginternal tei tei-ref" href="#Pg061">61</a>, <a class="pginternal tei tei-ref" href="#Pg062">62</a>, <a class="pginternal tei tei-ref" href="#Pg067">67</a>); and we shall see other experiences of the kind when we come to the subject of mysticism. The case of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bradley, that of M. Ratisbonne, possibly that of Colonel Gardiner, possibly that of Saint Paul, might not be so easily explained in this simple way. The result, then, would have to be ascribed either to a merely physiological nerve storm, a <span class="tei tei-q">“discharging lesion”</span> like that of epilepsy; or, in case it were useful and rational, as in the two latter cases named, to some more mystical or theological hypothesis. I make this remark in order that the reader may realize that the subject is really complex. But I shall keep myself as far as possible at present to the more <span class="tei tei-q">“scientific”</span> view; and only as the plot thickens in subsequent lectures shall I consider the question of its absolute sufficiency as an explanation of all the facts.

						<p>These reports of sensorial photism shade off into what are evidently only metaphorical accounts of the sense of new spiritual illumination, as, for instance, in Brainerd’s statement: <span class="tei tei-q">“As I was walking in a thick grove, unspeakable glory seemed to open to the apprehension of my soul. I do not mean any external brightness, for I saw no such thing, nor any imagination of a body of light in the third heavens, or anything of that nature, but it was a new inward apprehension or view that I had of God.”</span></p>
						<p>In a case like this next one from Starbuck’s manuscript collection, the lighting up of the darkness is probably also metaphorical:⁠—</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“One Sunday night, I resolved that when I got home to the ranch where I was working, I would offer myself with my faculties and all to God to be used only by and for him.⁠ ⁠… It was raining and the roads were muddy; but this desire grew so strong that I kneeled down by the side of the road and told God all about it, intending then to get up and go on. Such a thing as any special answer to my prayer never entered my mind, having been converted by faith, but still being most undoubtedly saved. Well, while I was praying, I remember holding out my hands to God and telling him they should work for him, my feet walk for him, my tongue speak for him, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, if he would only use me as his instrument and give me a satisfying experience⁠—when suddenly the darkness of the night seemed lit up⁠—I felt, realized, knew, that God heard and answered my prayer. Deep happiness came over me; I felt I was accepted into the inner circle of God’s loved ones.”</span>
						</p>
						<p>In the following case also the flash of light is metaphorical:⁠—</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“A prayer meeting had been called for at close of evening service. The minister supposed me impressed by his discourse (a mistake⁠—he was dull). He came and, placing his hand upon my shoulder, said: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Do you not want to give your heart to God?’</span> I replied in the affirmative. Then said he, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Come to the front seat.’</span> They sang and prayed and talked with me. I experienced nothing but unaccountable wretchedness. They declared that the reason why I did not <span class="tei tei-q">‘obtain peace’</span> was because I was not willing to give up all to God. After about two hours the minister said we would go home. As usual, on retiring, I prayed. In great distress, I at this time simply said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Lord, I have done all I can, I leave the whole matter with thee.’</span> Immediately, like a flash of light, there came to me a great peace, and I arose and went into my parents’ bedroom and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I do feel so wonderfully happy.’</span> This I regard as the hour of conversion. It was the hour in which I became assured of divine acceptance and favor. So far as my life was concerned, it made little immediate change.”</span>

I had a general feeling of buoyancy. It was the greatest joy it was ever my lot to experience.”</span>⁠—<span class="tei tei-q">“I wept and laughed alternately. I was as light as if walking on air.

					<p>The great thing which the higher excitabilities give is <em class="tei tei-emph">courage</em>; and the addition or subtraction of a certain amount of this quality makes a different man, a different life. Various excitements let the courage loose. Trustful hope will do it; inspiring example will do it; love will do it; wrath will do it. In some people it is natively so high that the mere touch of danger does it, though danger is for most men the great inhibitor of action. <span class="tei tei-q">“Love of adventure”</span> becomes in such persons a ruling passion. <span class="tei tei-q">“I believe,”</span> says General Skobeleff, <span class="tei tei-q">“that my bravery is simply the passion and at the same time the contempt of danger. The risk of life fills me with an exaggerated rapture. The fewer there are to share it, the more I like it. The participation of my body in the event is required to furnish me an adequate excitement. Everything intellectual appears to me to be reflex; but a meeting of man to man, a duel, a danger into which I can throw myself headforemost, attracts me, moves me, intoxicates me. I am crazy for it, I love it, I adore it. I run after danger as one runs after women; I wish it never to stop. Were it always the same, it would always bring me a new pleasure. When I throw myself into an adventure in which I hope to find it, my heart palpitates with the uncertainty; I could wish at once to have it appear and yet to delay.

						<p>Here, for example, is a case, from Starbuck’s book, in which a <span class="tei tei-q">“sensory automatism”</span> brought about quickly what prayers and resolves had been unable to effect. The subject is a woman. She writes:⁠—</p>
						<p><span class="tei tei-q">“When I was about forty I tried to quit smoking, but the desire was on me, and had me in its power. I cried and prayed and promised God to quit, but could not. I had smoked for fifteen years. When I was fifty-three, as I sat by the fire one day smoking, a voice came to me. I did not hear it with my ears, but more as a dream or sort of double think. It said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Louisa, lay down smoking.’</span> At once I replied, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Will you take the desire away?’</span> But it only kept saying: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Louisa, lay down smoking.’</span> Then I got up, laid my pipe on the mantelshelf, and never smoked again or had any desire to. The desire was gone as though I had never known it or touched tobacco. The sight of others smoking and the smell of smoke never gave me the least wish to touch it again.”</span> The Psychology of Religion, <abbr>p.</abbr> 142.</p>

						<p>Professor Starbuck expresses the radical destruction of old influences physiologically, as a cutting off of the connection between higher and lower cerebral centres. <span class="tei tei-q">“This condition,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“in which the association-centres connected with the spiritual life are cut off from the lower, is often reflected in the way correspondents describe their experiences.⁠ ⁠… For example: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Temptations from without still assail me, but there is nothing <em class="tei tei-emph">within</em> to respond to them.’</span> The ego [here] is wholly identified with the higher centres, whose quality of feeling is that of withinness. Another of the respondents says: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Since then, although Satan tempts me, there is as it were a wall of brass around me, so that his darts cannot touch me.’</span> ”</span>⁠—Unquestionably, functional exclusions of this sort must occur in the cerebral organ. But on the side accessible to introspection, their causal condition is nothing but the degree of spiritual excitement, getting at last so high and strong as to be sovereign; and it must be frankly confessed that we do not know just why or how such sovereignty comes about in one person and not in another. We can only give our imagination a certain delusive help by mechanical analogies.</p>
						<p>If we should conceive, for example, that the human mind, with its different possibilities of equilibrium, might be like a many-sided solid with different surfaces on which it could lie flat, we might liken mental revolutions to the spatial revolutions of such a body. As it is pried up, say by a lever, from a position in which it lies on surface A, for instance, it will linger for a time unstably halfway up, and if the lever cease to urge it, it will tumble back or <span class="tei tei-q">“relapse”</span> under the continued pull of gravity. But if at last it rotate far enough for its centre of gravity to pass beyond surface A altogether, the body will fall over, on surface B, say, and abide there permanently. The pulls of gravity towards A have vanished, and may now be disregarded. The polyhedron has become immune against farther attraction from their direction.</p>
						<p>In this figure of speech the lever may correspond to the emotional influences making for a new life, and the initial pull of gravity to the ancient drawbacks and inhibitions. So long as the emotional influence fails to reach a certain pitch of efficacy, the changes it produces are unstable, and the man relapses into his original attitude. But when a certain intensity is attained by the new emotion, a critical point is passed, and there then ensues an irreversible revolution, equivalent to the production of a new nature.</p>

						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“We would make known in our own persons the usefulness of rule, of discipline, of resignation and renunciation; we would teach the necessary perpetuity of suffering, and explain the creative part which it plays. We would wage war upon false optimism; on the base hope of happiness coming to us ready made; on the notion of a salvation by knowledge alone, or by material civilization alone, vain symbol as this is of civilization, precarious external arrangement, ill-fitted to replace the intimate union and consent of souls. We would wage war also on bad morals, whether in public or in private life; on luxury, fastidiousness, and overrefinement; on all that tends to increase the painful, immoral, and antisocial multiplication of our wants; on all that excites envy and dislike in the soul of the common people, and confirms the notion that the chief end of life is freedom to enjoy. We would preach by our example the respect of superiors and equals, the respect of all men; affectionate simplicity in our relations with inferiors and insignificant persons; indulgence where our own claims only are concerned, but firmness in our demands where they relate to duties towards others or towards the public.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“For the common people are what we help them to become; their vices are our vices, gazed upon, envied, and imitated; and if they come back with all their weight upon us, it is but just.”</span>

							<span class="tei tei-q">“At a meeting held at six the next morning, I heard a man relate his experience. He said: The Lord asked him if he would confess Christ among the quarrymen with whom he worked, and he said he would. Then he asked him if he would give up to be used of the Lord the four hundred dollars he had laid up, and he said he would, and thus the Lord saved him. The thought came to me at once that I had never made a real consecration either of myself or of my property to the Lord, but had always tried to serve the Lord in <em class="tei tei-emph">my</em> way. Now the Lord asked me if I would serve him in <em class="tei tei-emph">his</em> way, and go out alone and penniless if he so ordered. The question was pressed home, and I must decide: To forsake all and have him, or have all and lose him! I soon decided to take him; and the blessed assurance came, that he had taken me for his own, and my joy was full. I returned home from the meeting with feelings as simple as a child. I thought all would be glad to hear of the joy of the Lord that possessed me, and so I began to tell the simple story. But to my great surprise, the pastors (for I attended meetings in three churches) opposed the experience and said it was fanaticism, and one told the members of his church to shun those that professed it, and I soon found that my foes were those of my own household.”</span>

						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“The signs of abnormality which sanctified persons show are of frequent occurrence. They get out of tune with other people; often they will have nothing to do with churches, which they regard as worldly; they become hypercritical towards others; they grow careless of their social, political, and financial obligations. As an instance of this type may be mentioned a woman of sixty-eight of whom the writer made a special study. She had been a member of one of the most active and progressive churches in a busy part of a large city. Her pastor described her as having reached the censorious stage. She had grown more and more out of sympathy with the church; her connection with it finally consisted simply in attendance at prayer-meeting, at which her only message was that of reproof and condemnation of the others for living on a low plane. At last she withdrew from fellowship with any church. The writer found her living alone in a little room on the top story of a cheap boardinghouse, quite out of touch with all human relations, but apparently happy in the enjoyment of her own spiritual blessings. Her time was occupied in writing booklets on sanctification⁠—page after page of dreamy rhapsody. She proved to be one of a small group of persons who claim that entire salvation involves three steps instead of two; not only must there be conversion and sanctification, but a third, which they call <span class="tei tei-q">‘crucifixion’</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">‘perfect redemption,’</span> and which seems to bear the same relation to sanctification that this bears to conversion. She related how the Spirit had said to her, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Stop going to church. Stop going to holiness meetings. Go to your own room and I will teach you.’</span> She professes to care nothing for colleges, or preachers, or churches, but only cares to listen to what God says to her. Her description of her experience seemed entirely consistent; she is happy and contented, and her life is entirely satisfactory to herself. While listening to her own story, one was tempted to forget that it was from the life of a person who could not live by it in conjunction with her fellows.”</span>

						<p>The best missionary lives abound in the victorious combination of nonresistance with personal authority. John G. Paton, for example, in the New Hebrides, among brutish Melanesian cannibals, preserves a charmed life by dint of it. When it comes to the point, no one ever dares actually to strike him. Native converts, inspired by him, showed analogous virtue. <span class="tei tei-q">“One of our chiefs, full of the Christ-kindled desire to seek and to save, sent a message to an inland chief, that he and four attendants would come on Sabbath and tell them the gospel of Jehovah God. The reply came back sternly forbidding their visit, and threatening with death any Christian that approached their village. Our chief sent in response a loving message, telling them that Jehovah had taught the Christians to return good for evil, and that they would come unarmed to tell them the story of how the Son of God came into the world and died in order to bless and save his enemies. The heathen chief sent back a stern and prompt reply once more: <span class="tei tei-q">‘If you come, you will be killed.’</span> On Sabbath morn the Christian chief and his four companions were met outside the village by the heathen chief, who implored and threatened them once more. But the former said:⁠—</span></p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘We come to you without weapons of war! We come only to tell you about Jesus. We believe that He will protect us today.’</span></span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“As they pressed steadily forward towards the village, spears began to be thrown at them. Some they evaded, being all except one dexterous warriors; and others they literally received with their bare hands, and turned them aside in an incredible manner. The heathen, apparently thunderstruck at these men thus approaching them without weapons of war, and not even flinging back their own spears which they had caught, after having thrown what the old chief called <span class="tei tei-q">‘a shower of spears,’</span> desisted from mere surprise. Our Christian chief called out, as he and his companions drew up in the midst of them on the village public ground:⁠—</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Jehovah thus protects us. He has given us all your spears! Once we would have thrown them back at you and killed you. But now we come, not to fight but to tell you about Jesus. He has changed our dark hearts. He asks you now to lay down all these your other weapons of war, and to hear what we can tell you about the love of God, our great Father, the only living God.’</span></span>
						</p>
						<p><span class="tei tei-q">“The heathen were perfectly overawed. They manifestly looked on these Christians as protected by some Invisible One. They listened for the first time to the story of the Gospel and of the Cross. We lived to see that chief and all his tribe sitting in the school of Christ. And there is perhaps not an island in these southern seas, amongst all those won for Christ, where similar acts of heroism on the part of converts cannot be recited.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi">John G.

The little sleep he allowed nature to take was snatched in a sitting posture, his head leaning against a piece of wood fixed in the wall. Even had he wished to lie down, it would have been impossible, because his cell was only four feet and a half long. In the course of all these years he never raised his hood, no matter what the ardor of the sun or the rain’s strength. He never put on a shoe. He wore a garment of coarse sackcloth, with nothing else upon his skin. This garment was as scant as possible, and over it a little cloak of the same stuff. When the cold was great he took off the cloak and opened for a while the door and little window of his cell. Then he closed them and resumed the mantle⁠—his way, as he told us, of warming himself, and making his body feel a better temperature. It was a frequent thing with him to eat once only in three days; and when I expressed my surprise, he said that it was very easy if one once had acquired the habit. One of his companions has assured me that he has gone sometimes eight days without food.⁠ ⁠… His poverty was extreme; and his mortification, even in his youth, was such that he told me he had passed three years in a house of his order without knowing any of the monks otherwise than by the sound of their voice, for he never raised his eyes, and only found his way about by following the others. He showed this same modesty on public highways. He spent many years without ever laying eyes upon a woman; but he confessed to me that at the age he had reached it was indifferent to him whether he laid eyes on them or not. He was very old when I first came to know him, and his body so attenuated that it seemed formed of nothing so much as of so many roots of trees. With all this sanctity he was very affable. He never spoke unless he was questioned, but his intellectual right-mindedness and grace gave to all his words an irresistible charm.”</span><a href="#noteref_214" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

							<span class="tei tei-q">“I have never had any revelations through anaesthetics, but a kind of waking trance⁠—this for lack of a better word⁠—I have frequently had, quite up from boyhood, when I have been all alone. This has come upon me through repeating my own name to myself silently, till all at once, as it were out of the intensity of the consciousness of individuality, individuality itself seemed to dissolve and fade away into boundless being, and this not a confused state but the clearest, the surest of the surest, utterly beyond words⁠—where death was an almost laughable impossibility⁠—the loss of personality (if so it were) seeming no extinction, but the only true life.

						<p><span class="tei tei-hi">Benjamin Paul Blood</span>: The Anaesthetic Revelation and the Gist of Philosophy, Amsterdam, N. Y., 1874, <abbr>pp.</abbr> 35, 36. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Blood has made several attempts to adumbrate the anaesthetic revelation, in pamphlets of rare literary distinction, privately printed and distributed by himself at Amsterdam. Xenos Clark, a philosopher, who died young at Amherst in the ‘80’s, much lamented by those who knew him, was also impressed by the revelation. <span class="tei tei-q">“In the first place,”</span> he once wrote to me, <span class="tei tei-q">“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Blood and I agree that the revelation is, if anything, non-emotional. It is utterly flat. It is, as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Blood says, <span class="tei tei-q">‘the one sole and sufficient insight why, or not why, but how, the present is pushed on by the past, and sucked forward by the vacuity of the future. Its inevitableness defeats all attempts at stopping or accounting for it. It is all precedence and presupposition, and questioning is in regard to it forever too late. It is an <em class="tei tei-emph">initiation of the past</em>.’</span> The real secret would be the formula by which the <span class="tei tei-q">‘now’</span> keeps exfoliating out of itself, yet never escapes. What is it, indeed, that keeps existence exfoliating? The formal being of anything, the logical definition of it, is static. For mere logic every question contains its own answer⁠—we simply fill the hole with the dirt we dug out. Why are twice two four? Because, in fact, four is twice two. Thus logic finds in life no propulsion, only a momentum. It goes because it is a-going. But the revelation adds: it goes because it is and <em class="tei tei-emph">was</em> a-going. You walk, as it were, round yourself in the revelation. Ordinary philosophy is like a hound hunting his own trail. The more he hunts the farther he has to go, and his nose never catches up with his heels, because it is forever ahead of them. So the present is already a foregone conclusion, and I am ever too late to understand it. But at the moment of recovery from anæsthesis, just then, <em class="tei tei-emph">before starting on life</em>, I catch, so to speak, a glimpse of my heels, a glimpse of the eternal process just in the act of starting. The truth is that we travel on a journey that was accomplished before we set out; and the real end of philosophy is accomplished, not when we arrive at, but when we remain in, our destination (being already there)⁠—which may occur vicariously in this life when we cease our intellectual questioning. That is why there is a smile upon the face of the revelation, as we view it. It tells us that we are forever half a second too late⁠—that’s all. <span class="tei tei-q">‘You could kiss your own lips, and have all the fun to yourself,’</span> it says, if you only knew the trick. It would be perfectly easy if they would just stay there till you got round to them. Why don’t you manage it somehow?”</span></p>
						<p>Dialectically minded readers of this farrago will at least recognize the region of thought of which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Clark writes, as familiar. In his latest pamphlet, <span class="tei tei-q">“Tennyson’s Trances and the Anaesthetic Revelation,”</span> <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Blood describes its value for life as follows:⁠—</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“The Anaesthetic Revelation is the Initiation of Man into the Immemorial Mystery of the Open Secret of Being, revealed as the Inevitable Vortex of Continuity. Inevitable is the word. Its motive is inherent⁠—it is what has to be. It is not for any love or hate, nor for joy nor sorrow, nor good nor ill. End, beginning, or purpose, it knows not of.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“It affords no particular of the multiplicity and variety of things; but it fills appreciation of the historical and the sacred with a secular and intimately personal illumination of the nature and motive of existence, which then seems reminiscent⁠—as if it should have appeared, or shall yet appear, to every participant thereof.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“Although it is at first startling in its solemnity, it becomes directly such a matter of course⁠—so old-fashioned, and so akin to proverbs, that it inspires exultation rather than fear, and a sense of safety, as identified with the aboriginal and the universal. But no words may express the imposing certainty of the patient that he is realizing the primordial, Adamic surprise of Life.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“Repetition of the experience finds it ever the same, and as if it could not possibly be otherwise. The subject resumes his normal consciousness only to partially and fitfully remember its occurrence, and to try to formulate its baffling import⁠—with only this consolatory afterthought: that he has known the oldest truth, and that he has done with human theories as to the origin, meaning, or destiny of the race. He is beyond instruction in <span class="tei tei-q">‘spiritual things.’</span></span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“The lesson is one of central safety: the Kingdom is within. All days are judgment days: but there can be no climacteric purpose of eternity, nor any scheme of the whole. The astronomer abridges the row of bewildering figures by increasing his unit of measurement: so may we reduce the distracting multiplicity of things to the unity for which each of us stands.</span>
						</p>
						<p><span class="tei tei-q">“This has been my moral sustenance since I have known of it. In my first printed mention of it I declared: <span class="tei tei-q">‘The world is no more the alien terror that was taught me. Spurning the cloud-grimed and still sultry battlements whence so lately Jehovan thunders boomed, my gray gull lifts her wing against the nightfall, and takes the dim leagues with a fearless eye.’</span> And now, after twenty-seven years of this experience, the wing is grayer, but the eye is fearless still, while I renew and doubly emphasize that declaration. I know⁠—as having known⁠—the meaning of Existence: the sane centre of the universe⁠—at once the wonder and the assurance of the soul⁠—for which the speech of reason has as yet no name but the Anaesthetic Revelation.”</span>⁠—I have considerably abridged the quotation.</p>

						<p>Op. cit., <abbr>pp.</abbr> 78⁠–⁠80, abridged. I subjoin, also abridging it, another interesting anaesthetic revelation communicated to me in manuscript by a friend in England. The subject, a gifted woman, was taking ether for a surgical operation.</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“I wondered if I was in a prison being tortured, and why I remembered having heard it said that people <span class="tei tei-q">‘learn through suffering,’</span> and in view of what I was seeing, the inadequacy of this saying struck me so much that I said, aloud, <span class="tei tei-q">‘to suffer <em class="tei tei-emph">is</em> to learn.’</span></span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“With that I became unconscious again, and my last dream immediately preceded my real coming to. It only lasted a few seconds, and was most vivid and real to me, though it may not be clear in words.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“A great Being or Power was traveling through the sky, his foot was on a kind of lightning as a wheel is on a rail, it was his pathway. The lightning was made entirely of the spirits of innumerable people close to one another, and I was one of them. He moved in a straight line, and each part of the streak or flash came into its short conscious existence only that he might travel. I seemed to be directly under the foot of God, and I thought he was grinding his own life up out of my pain. Then I saw that what he had been trying with all his might to do was to <em class="tei tei-emph">change his course</em>, to <em class="tei tei-emph">bend</em> the line of lightning to which he was tied, in the direction in which he wanted to go. I felt my flexibility and helplessness, and knew that he would succeed. He bended me, turning his corner by means of my hurt, hurting me more than I had ever been hurt in my life, and at the acutest point of this, as he passed, I <em class="tei tei-emph">saw</em>. I understood for a moment things that I have now forgotten, things that no one could remember while retaining sanity. The angle was an obtuse angle, and I remember thinking as I woke that had he made it a right or acute angle, I should have both suffered and <span class="tei tei-q">‘seen’</span> still more, and should probably have died.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“He went on and I came to. In that moment the whole of my life passed before me, including each little meaningless piece of distress, and I <em class="tei tei-emph">understood</em> them. <em class="tei tei-emph">This</em> was what it had all meant, <em class="tei tei-emph">this</em> was the piece of work it had all been contributing to do. I did not see God’s purpose, I only saw his intentness and his entire relentlessness towards his means. He thought no more of me than a man thinks of hurting a cork when he is opening wine, or hurting a cartridge when he is firing. And yet, on waking, my first feeling was, and it came with tears, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Domine non sum digna,’</span> for I had been lifted into a position for which I was too small. I realized that in that half hour under ether I had served God more distinctly and purely than I had ever done in my life before, or that I am capable of desiring to do. I was the means of his achieving and revealing something, I know not what or to whom, and that, to the exact extent of my capacity for suffering.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“While regaining consciousness, I wondered why, since I had gone so deep, I had seen nothing of what the saints call the <em class="tei tei-emph">love</em> of God, nothing but his relentlessness. And then I heard an answer, which I could only just catch, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Knowledge and Love are One, and the <em class="tei tei-emph">measure</em> is suffering’</span>⁠—I give the words as they came to me. With that I came finally to (into what seemed a dream world compared with the reality of what I was leaving), and I saw that what would be called the <span class="tei tei-q">‘cause’</span> of my experience was a slight operation under insufficient ether, in a bed pushed up against a window, a common city window in a common city street. If I had to formulate a few of the things I then caught a glimpse of, they would run somewhat as follows:⁠—</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“The eternal necessity of suffering and its eternal vicariousness. The veiled and incommunicable nature of the worst sufferings;⁠—the passivity of genius, how it is essentially instrumental and defenseless, moved, not moving, it must do what it does;⁠—the impossibility of discovery without its price;⁠—finally, the excess of what the suffering <span class="tei tei-q">‘seer’</span> or genius pays over what his generation gains. (He seems like one who sweats his life out to earn enough to save a district from famine, and just as he staggers back, dying and satisfied, bringing a lac of rupees to buy grain with, God lifts the lac away, dropping <em class="tei tei-emph">one</em> rupee, and says, <span class="tei tei-q">‘That you may give them. That you have earned for them. The rest is for ME.’</span>) I perceived also in a way never to be forgotten, the excess of what we see over what we can demonstrate.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“And so on!⁠—these things may seem to you delusions, or truisms; but for me they are dark truths, and the power to put them into even such words as these has been given me by an ether dream.”</span>

						<p>The larger God may then swallow up the smaller one. I take this from Starbuck’s manuscript collection:⁠—</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“I never lost the consciousness of the presence of God until I stood at the foot of the Horseshoe Falls, Niagara. Then I lost him in the immensity of what I saw. I also lost myself, feeling that I was an atom too small for the notice of Almighty God.”</span>
						</p>
						<p>I subjoin another similar case from Starbuck’s collection:⁠—</p>
						<p><span class="tei tei-q">“In that time the consciousness of God’s nearness came to me sometimes. I say God, to describe what is indescribable. A presence, I might say, yet that is too suggestive of personality, and the moments of which I speak did not hold the consciousness of a personality, but something in myself made me feel myself a part of something bigger than I, that was controlling. I felt myself one with the grass, the trees, birds, insects, everything in Nature. I exulted in the mere fact of existence, of being a part of it all⁠—the drizzling rain, the shadows of the clouds, the tree-trunks, and so on. In the years following, such moments continued to come, but I wanted them constantly. I knew so well the satisfaction of losing self in a perception of supreme power and love, that I was unhappy because that perception was not constant.”</span> The cases quoted in my third lecture, <abbr>pp.</abbr> <a class="pginternal tei tei-ref" href="#Pg066">66</a>, <a class="pginternal tei tei-ref" href="#Pg067">67</a>, <a class="pginternal tei tei-ref" href="#Pg070">70</a>, are still better ones of this type. In her essay, The Loss of Personality, in The Atlantic Monthly (<abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">lxxxv</span>. <abbr>p.</abbr> 195), Miss Ethel D. Puffer explains that the vanishing of the sense of self, and the feeling of immediate unity with the object, is due to the disappearance, in these rapturous experiences, of the motor adjustments which habitually intermediate between the constant background of consciousness (which is the Self) and the object in the foreground, whatever it may be. I must refer the reader to the highly instructive article, which seems to me to throw light upon the psychological conditions, though it fails to account for the rapture or the revelation-value of the experience in the Subject’s eyes.</p>

I knew and saw in myself all the three worlds, the external and visible world being of a procreation or extern birth from both the internal and spiritual worlds; and I saw and knew the whole working essence, in the evil and in the good, and the mutual original and existence; and likewise how the fruitful bearing womb of eternity brought forth. So that I did not only greatly wonder at it, but did also exceedingly rejoice, albeit I could very hardly apprehend the same in my external man and set it down with the pen.

						<p>From a French book I take this mystical expression of happiness in God’s indwelling presence:⁠—</p>
						<p><span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus has come to take up his abode in my heart. It is not so much a habitation, an association, as a sort of fusion. Oh, new and blessed life! life which becomes each day more luminous.⁠ ⁠… The wall before me, dark a few moments since, is splendid at this hour because the sun shines on it. Wherever its rays fall they light up a conflagration of glory; the smallest speck of glass sparkles, each grain of sand emits fire; even so there is a royal song of triumph in my heart because the Lord is there. My days succeed each other; yesterday a blue sky; today a clouded sun; a night filled with strange dreams; but as soon as the eyes open, and I regain consciousness and seem to begin life again, it is always the same figure before me, always the same presence filling my heart.⁠ ⁠… Formerly the day was dulled by the absence of the Lord. I used to wake invaded by all sorts of sad impressions, and I did not find him on my path. Today he is with me; and the light cloudiness which covers things is not an obstacle to my communion with him. I feel the pressure of his hand, I feel something else which fills me with a serene joy; shall I dare to speak it out? Yes, for it is the true expression of what I experience. The Holy Spirit is not merely making me a visit; it is no mere dazzling apparition which may from one moment to another spread its wings and leave me in my night, it is a permanent habitation. He can depart only if he takes me with him. More than that; he is not other than myself: he is one with me. It is not a juxtaposition, it is a penetration, a profound modification of my nature, a new manner of my being.”</span> Quoted from the <abbr>MS.</abbr> <span class="tei tei-q">“of an old man”</span> by <span class="tei tei-hi">Wilfred Monod</span>: Il Vit: six méditations sur le mystère chrétien, <abbr>pp.</abbr> 280⁠–⁠283.</p>

He explains such perception by the abundant uncompleted associations which experiences may arouse in a degenerate brain.

The explanation is a plausible one for certain sorts of feeling of significance; and other alienists (<span class="tei tei-hi">Wernicke</span>, for example, in his Grundriss der Psychiatrie, Theil <span epub:type="z3998:roman">ii</span>., Leipzig, 1896) have explained <span class="tei tei-q">“paranoiac”</span> conditions by a laming of the association-organ.

						<p>It must not be forgotten that any form of <em class="tei tei-emph">dis</em>order in the world might, by the design argument, suggest a God for just that kind of disorder. The truth is that any state of things whatever that can be named is logically susceptible of teleological interpretation. The ruins of the earthquake at Lisbon, for example: the whole of past history had to be planned exactly as it was to bring about in the fullness of time just that particular arrangement of debris of masonry, furniture, and once living bodies. No other train of causes would have been sufficient. And so of any other arrangement, bad or good, which might as a matter of fact be found resulting anywhere from previous conditions. To avoid such pessimistic consequences and save its beneficent designer, the design argument accordingly invokes two other principles, restrictive in their operation. The first is physical: Nature’s forces tend of their own accord only to disorder and destruction, to heaps of ruins, not to architecture. This principle, though plausible at first sight, seems, in the light of recent biology, to be more and more improbable. The second principle is one of anthropomorphic interpretation. No arrangement that for <em class="tei tei-emph">us</em> is <span class="tei tei-q">“disorderly”</span> can possibly have been an object of design at all. This principle is of course a mere assumption in the interests of anthropomorphic Theism.</p>
						<p>When one views the world with no definite theological bias one way or the other, one sees that order and disorder, as we now recognize them, are purely human inventions. We are interested in certain types of arrangement, useful, aesthetic, or moral⁠—so interested that whenever we find them realized, the fact emphatically rivets our attention. The result is that we work over the contents of the world selectively. It is overflowing with disorderly arrangements from our point of view, but order is the only thing we care for and look at, and by choosing, one can always find some sort of orderly arrangement in the midst of any chaos. If I should throw down a thousand beans at random upon a table, I could doubtless, by eliminating a sufficient number of them, leave the rest in almost any geometrical pattern you might propose to me, and you might then say that that pattern was the thing prefigured beforehand, and that the other beans were mere irrelevance and packing material. Our dealings with Nature are just like this. She is a vast <span class="tei tei-foreign">plenum</span> in which our attention draws capricious lines in innumerable directions. We count and name whatever lies upon the special lines we trace, whilst the other things and the untraced lines are neither named nor counted. There are in reality infinitely more things ‘unadapted’ to each other in this world than there are things ‘adapted’; infinitely more things with irregular relations than with regular relations between them. But we look for the regular kind of thing exclusively, and ingeniously discover and preserve it in our memory. It accumulates with other regular kinds, until the collection of them fills our encyclopædias. Yet all the while between and around them lies an infinite anonymous chaos of objects that no one ever thought of together, of relations that never yet attracted our attention.</p>
						<p>The facts of order from which the physico-theological argument starts are thus easily susceptible of interpretation as arbitrary human products. So long as this is the case, although of course no argument against God follows, it follows that the argument for him will fail to constitute a knockdown proof of his existence. It will be convincing only to those who on other grounds believe in him already.</p>

					<p>Pragmatically, the most important attribute of God is his punitive justice. But who, in the present state of theological opinion on that point, will dare maintain that hell fire or its equivalent in some shape is rendered certain by pure logic? Theology herself has largely based this doctrine upon revelation; and, in discussing it, has tended more and more to substitute conventional ideas of criminal law for a priori principles of reason. But the very notion that this glorious universe, with planets and winds, and laughing sky and ocean, should have been conceived and had its beams and rafters laid in technicalities of criminality, is incredible to our modern imagination.

						<p>The most persuasive arguments in favor of a concrete individual Soul of the world, with which I am acquainted, are those of my colleague, Josiah Royce, in his Religious Aspect of Philosophy, Boston, 1885; in his Conception of God, New York and London, 1897; and lately in his Aberdeen Gifford Lectures, The World and the Individual, 2 <abbr>vols.</abbr>, New York and London, 1901⁠–⁠02. I doubtless seem to some of my readers to evade the philosophic duty which my thesis in this lecture imposes on me, by not even attempting to meet Professor Royce’s arguments articulately. I admit the momentary evasion. In the present lectures, which are cast throughout in a popular mould, there seemed no room for subtle metaphysical discussion, and for tactical purposes it was sufficient, the contention of philosophy being what it is (namely, that religion can be transformed into a universally convincing science), to point to the fact that no religious philosophy has actually convinced the mass of thinkers. Meanwhile let me say that I hope that the present volume may be followed by another, if I am spared to write it, in which not only Professor Royce’s arguments, but others for monistic absolutism shall be considered with all the technical fullness which their great importance calls for. At present I resign myself to lying passive under the reproach of superficiality.</p>

						<p>I cannot resist the temptation of quoting an expression of an even more primitive style of religious thought, which I find in Arber’s English Garland, <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">vii</span>. <abbr>p.</abbr> 440. Robert Lyde, an English sailor, along with an English boy, being prisoners on a French ship in 1689, set upon the crew, of seven Frenchmen, killed two, made the other five prisoners, and brought home the ship. Lyde thus describes how in this feat he found his God a very present help in time of trouble:⁠—</p>
						<p><span class="tei tei-q">“With the assistance of God I kept my feet when they three and one more did strive to throw me down. Feeling the Frenchman which hung about my middle hang very heavy, I said to the boy, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Go round the binnacle, and knock down that man that hangeth on my back.’</span> So the boy did strike him one blow on the head which made him fall.⁠ ⁠… Then I looked about for a marlin spike or anything else to strike them withal. But seeing nothing, I said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi">Lord!</span> what shall I do?’</span> Then casting up my eye upon my left side, and seeing a marlin spike hanging, I jerked my right arm and took hold, and struck the point four times about a quarter of an inch deep into the skull of that man that had hold of my left arm. [One of the Frenchmen then hauled the marlin spike away from him.] But through <span class="tei tei-hi">God’s</span> wonderful providence! it either fell out of his hand, or else he threw it down, and at this time the Almighty <span class="tei tei-hi">God</span> gave me strength enough to take one man in one hand, and throw at the other’s head: and looking about again to see anything to strike them withal, but seeing nothing, I said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi">Lord!</span> what shall I do now?’</span> And then it pleased <span class="tei tei-hi">God</span> to put me in mind of my knife in my pocket. And although two of the men had hold of my right arm, yet <span class="tei tei-hi">God</span> Almighty strengthened me so that I put my right hand into my right pocket, drew out the knife and sheath,⁠ ⁠… put it between my legs and drew it out, and then cut the man’s throat with it that had his back to my breast: and he immediately dropt down, and scarce ever stirred after.”</span>⁠—I have slightly abridged Lyde’s narrative.</p>

					<p>A friend of mine, a first-rate psychologist, who is a subject of graphic automatism, tells me that the appearance of independent actuation in the movements of his arm, when he writes automatically, is so distinct that it obliges him to abandon a psycho-physical theory which he had previously believed in, the theory, namely, that we have no feeling of the discharge downwards of our voluntary motor-centres.

							<span class="tei tei-q">“It may be very interesting for you to know that the President [<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Snow] of the Mormon Church claims to have had a number of revelations very recently from heaven.

This Church has at its head a prophet, seer, and revelator, who gives to man God’s holy will. Revelation is the means through which the will of God is declared directly and in fullness to man. These revelations are got through dreams of sleep or in waking visions of the mind, by voices without visional appearance, or by actual manifestations of the Holy Presence before the eye. We believe that God has come in person and spoken to our prophet and revelator.”</span>

The <span class="tei tei-q">“heroic”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“solemn”</span> way in which life comes to them is a <span class="tei tei-q">“higher synthesis”</span> into which healthy-mindedness and morbidness both enter and combine.

In the cases which were quoted in Lecture <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, of the mind-cure form of healthy-mindedness, we found abundant examples of regenerative process. The severity of the crisis in this process is a matter of degree. How long one shall continue to drink the consciousness of evil, and when one shall begin to short-circuit and get rid of it, are also matters of amount and degree, so that in many instances it is quite arbitrary whether we class the individual as a once-born or a twice-born subject.<a href="#noteref_329" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Since men are the most reasonable of creatures, and able to infer God’s invisible being from the contemplation of the world, the sun in so far forth contributes to the primary purpose of creation: without it the race of man could not be preserved or continued.⁠ ⁠… The sun makes daylight, not only on our earth, but also on the other planets; and daylight is of the utmost utility to us; for by its means we can commodiously carry on those occupations which in the nighttime would either be quite impossible, or at any rate impossible without our going to the expense of artificial light. The beasts of the field can find food by day which they would not be able to find at night. Moreover we owe it to the sunlight that we are able to see everything that is on the earth’s surface, not only near by, but also at a distance, and to recognize both near and far things according to their species, which again is of manifold use to us not only in the business necessary to human life, and when we are traveling, but also for the scientific knowledge of Nature, which knowledge for the most part depends on observations made with the help of sight, and, without the sunshine, would have been impossible. If any one would rightly impress on his mind the great advantages which he derives from the sun, let him imagine himself living through only one month, and see how it would be with all his undertakings, if it were not day but night. He would then be sufficiently convinced out of his own experience, especially if he had much work to carry on in the street or in the fields.⁠ ⁠… From the sun we learn to recognize when it is midday, and by knowing this point of time exactly, we can set our clocks right, on which account astronomy owes much to the sun.⁠ ⁠… By help of the sun one can find the meridian.⁠ ⁠… But the meridian is the basis of our sundials, and generally speaking, we should have no sundials if we had no sun.”</span> Vernünftige Gedanken von den Absichten der natürlichen Dinge, 1782, <abbr>pp.</abbr> 74⁠–⁠84.</p>
						<p>Or read the account of God’s beneficence in the institution of <span class="tei tei-q">“the great variety throughout the world of men’s faces, voices, and handwriting,”</span> given in Derham’s Physico-theology, a book that had much vogue in the eighteenth century. <span class="tei tei-q">“Had Man’s body,”</span> says <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Derham, <span class="tei tei-q">“been made according to any of the Atheistical Schemes, or any other Method than that of the infinite Lord of the World, this wise Variety would never have been: but Men’s Faces would have been cast in the same, or not a very different Mould, their Organs of Speech would have sounded the same or not so great a Variety of Notes; and the same Structure of Muscles and Nerves would have given the Hand the same Direction in Writing. And in this Case, what Confusion, what Disturbance, what Mischiefs would the world eternally have lain under! No Security could have been to our persons; no Certainty, no Enjoyment of our Possessions; no Justice between Man and Man; no Distinction between Good and Bad, between Friends and Foes, between Father and Child, Husband and Wife, Male or Female; but all would have been turned topsy-turvy, by being exposed to the Malice of the Envious and ill-Natured, to the Fraud and Violence of Knaves and Robbers, to the Forgeries of the crafty Cheat, to the Lusts of the Effeminate and Debauched, and whatnot! Our Courts of Justice can abundantly testify the dire Effects of Mistaking Men’s Faces, of counterfeiting their Hands, and forging Writings. But now as the infinitely wise Creator and Ruler hath ordered the Matter, every man’s Face can distinguish him in the Light, and his Voice in the Dark; his Handwriting can speak for him though absent, and be his Witness, and secure his Contracts in future Generations. A manifest as well as admirable Indication of the divine Superintendence and Management.”</span></p>
						<p>A God so careful as to make provision even for the unmistakable signing of bank checks and deeds was a deity truly after the heart of eighteenth century Anglicanism.</p>
						<p>I subjoin, omitting the capitals, Derham’s <span class="tei tei-q">“Vindication of God by the Institution of Hills and Valleys,”</span> and Wolff’s altogether culinary account of the institution of Water:⁠—</p>
						<p><span class="tei tei-q">“The uses,”</span> says Wolff, <span class="tei tei-q">“which water serves in human life are plain to see and need not be described at length. Water is a universal drink of man and beasts. Even though men have made themselves drinks that are artificial, they could not do this without water. Beer is brewed of water and malt, and it is the water in it which quenches thirst. Wine is prepared from grapes, which could never have grown without the help of water; and the same is true of those drinks which in England and other places they produce from fruit.⁠ ⁠… Therefore since God so planned the world that men and beasts should live upon it and find there everything required for their necessity and convenience, he also made water as one means whereby to make the earth into so excellent a dwelling. And this is all the more manifest when we consider the advantages which we obtain from this same water for the cleaning of our household utensils, of our clothing, and of other matters.⁠ ⁠… When one goes into a grinding-mill one sees that the grindstone must always be kept wet and then one will get a still greater idea of the use of water.”</span></p>
						<p>Of the hills and valleys, Derham, after praising their beauty, discourses as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“Some constitutions are indeed of so happy a strength, and so confirmed an health, as to be indifferent to almost any place or temperature of the air. But then others are so weakly and feeble, as not to be able to bear one, but can live comfortably in another place. With some the more subtle and finer air of the hills doth best agree, who are languishing and dying in the feculent and grosser air of great towns, or even the warmer and vaporous air of the valleys and waters. But contrariwise, others languish on the hills, and grow lusty and strong in the warmer air of the valleys.</span></p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“So that this opportunity of shifting our abode from the hills to the vales, is an admirable easement, refreshment, and great benefit to the valetudinarian, feeble part of mankind; affording those an easy and comfortable life, who would otherwise live miserably, languish, and pine away.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“To this salutary conformation of the earth we may add another great convenience of the hills, and that is affording commodious places for habitation, serving (as an eminent author wordeth it) as screens to keep off the cold and nipping blasts of the northern and easterly winds, and reflecting the benign and cherishing sunbeams, and so rendering our habitations both more comfortable and more cheerly in winter.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“Lastly, it is to the hills that the fountains owe their rise and the rivers their conveyance, and consequently those vast masses and lofty piles are not, as they are charged, such rude and useless excrescences of our ill-formed globe; but the admirable tools of nature, contrived and ordered by the infinite Creator, to do one of its most useful works. For, was the surface of the earth even and level, and the middle parts of its islands and continents not mountainous and high as now it is, it is most certain there could be no descent for the rivers, no conveyance for the waters; but, instead of gliding along those gentle declivities which the higher lands now afford them quite down to the sea, they would stagnate and perhaps stink, and also drown large tracts of land.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“[Thus] the hills and vales, though to a peevish and weary traveler they may seem incommodious and troublesome, yet are a noble work of the great Creator, and wisely appointed by him for the good of our sublunary world.”</span>

						<p>Until the seventeenth century this mode of thought prevailed. One need only recall the dramatic treatment even of mechanical questions by Aristotle, as, for example, his explanation of the power of the lever to make a small weight raise a larger one. This is due, according to Aristotle, to the generally miraculous character of the circle and of all circular movement. The circle is both convex and concave; it is made by a fixed point and a moving line, which contradict each other; and whatever moves in a circle moves in opposite directions. Nevertheless, movement in a circle is the most <span class="tei tei-q">“natural”</span> movement; and the long arm of the lever, moving, as it does, in the larger circle, has the greater amount of this natural motion, and consequently requires the lesser force. Or recall the explanation by Herodotus of the position of the sun in winter: It moves to the south because of the cold which drives it into the warm parts of the heavens over Libya. Or listen to Saint Augustine’s speculations: <span class="tei tei-q">“Who gave to chaff such power to freeze that it preserves snow buried under it, and such power to warm that it ripens green fruit? Who can explain the strange properties of fire itself, which blackens all that it burns, though itself bright, and which, though of the most beautiful colors, discolors almost all that it touches and feeds upon, and turns blazing fuel into grimy cinders?⁠ ⁠… Then what wonderful properties do we find in charcoal, which is so brittle that a light tap breaks it, and a slight pressure pulverizes it, and yet is so strong that no moisture rots it, nor any time causes it to decay.”</span> City of God, book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">xxi</span>. ch. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">iv</span>.</p>
						<p>Such aspects of things as these, their naturalness and unnaturalness, the sympathies and antipathies of their superficial qualities, their eccentricities, their brightness and strength and destructiveness, were inevitably the ways in which they originally fastened our attention.</p>
						<p>If you open early medical books, you will find sympathetic magic invoked on every page. Take, for example, the famous vulnerary ointment attributed to Paracelsus. For this there were a variety of receipts, including usually human fat, the fat of either a bull, a wild boar, or a bear; powdered earthworms, the <span class="tei tei-foreign">usnia</span>, or mossy growth on the weathered skull of a hanged criminal, and other materials equally unpleasant⁠—the whole prepared under the planet Venus if possible, but never under Mars or Saturn. Then, if a splinter of wood, dipped in the patient’s blood, or the bloodstained weapon that wounded him, be immersed in this ointment, the wound itself being tightly bound up, the latter infallibly gets well⁠—I quote now Van Helmont’s account⁠—for the blood on the weapon or splinter, containing in it the spirit of the wounded man, is roused to active excitement by the contact of the ointment, whence there results to it a full commission or power to cure its cousin-german, the blood in the patient’s body. This it does by sucking out the dolorous and exotic impression from the wounded part. But to do this it has to implore the aid of the bull’s fat, and other portions of the unguent. The reason why bull’s fat is so powerful is that the bull at the time of slaughter is full of secret reluctancy and vindictive murmurs, and therefore dies with a higher flame of revenge about him than any other animal. And thus we have made it out, says this author, that the admirable efficacy of the ointment ought to be imputed, not to any auxiliary concurrence of Satan, but simply to the energy of the <em class="tei tei-emph">posthumous character of Revenge</em> remaining firmly impressed upon the blood and concreted fat in the unguent. <span class="tei tei-hi">J. B. Van Helmont</span>: A Ternary of Paradoxes, translated by <span class="tei tei-hi">Walter Charleton</span>, London, 1650.⁠—I much abridge the original in my citations.</p>
						<p>The author goes on to prove by the analogy of many other natural facts that this sympathetic action between things at a distance is the true rationale of the case. <span class="tei tei-q">“If,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“the heart of a horse, slain by a witch, taken out of the yet reeking carcase, be impaled upon an arrow and roasted, immediately the whole witch becomes tormented with the insufferable pains and cruelty of the fire, which could by no means happen unless there preceded a conjunction of the spirit of the witch with the spirit of the horse. In the reeking and yet panting heart, the spirit of the witch is kept captive, and the retreat of it prevented by the arrow transfixed. Similarly hath not many a murdered carcase at the coroner’s inquest suffered a fresh hæmorrhage or cruentation at the presence of the assassin?⁠—the blood being, as in a furious fit of anger, enraged and agitated by the impress of revenge conceived against the murderer, at the instant of the soul’s compulsive exile from the body. So, if you have dropsy, gout, or jaundice, by including some of your warm blood in the shell and white of an egg, which, exposed to a gentle heat, and mixed with a bait of flesh, you shall give to a hungry dog or hog, the disease shall instantly pass from you into the animal, and leave you entirely. And similarly again, if you burn some of the milk either of a cow or of a woman, the gland from which it issued will dry up. A gentleman at Brussels had his nose mowed off in a combat, but the celebrated surgeon Tagliacozzus digged a new nose for him out of the skin of the arm of a porter at Bologna. About thirteen months after his return to his own country, the engrafted nose grew cold, putrefied, and in a few days dropped off, and it was then discovered that the porter had expired, near about the same punctilio of time. There are still at Brussels eyewitnesses of this occurrence,”</span> says Van Helmont; and adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“I pray what is there in this of superstition or of exalted imagination?”</span></p>
						<p>Modern mind-cure literature⁠—the works of Prentice Mulford, for example⁠—is full of sympathetic magic.</p>

						<p>Even the errors of fact may possibly turn out not to be as wholesale as the scientist assumes. We saw in Lecture <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> how the religious conception of the universe seems to many mind-curers ‘verified’ from day to day by their experience of fact. <span class="tei tei-q">“Experience of fact”</span> is a field with so many things in it that the sectarian scientist, methodically declining, as he does, to recognize such <span class="tei tei-q">“facts”</span> as mind-curers and others like them experience, otherwise than by such rude heads of classification as <span class="tei tei-q">“bosh,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“rot,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“folly,”</span> certainly leaves out a mass of raw fact which, save for the industrious interest of the religious in the more personal aspects of reality, would never have succeeded in getting itself recorded at all. We know this to be true already in certain cases; it may, therefore, be true in others as well. Miraculous healings have always been part of the supernaturalist stock in trade, and have always been dismissed by the scientist as figments of the imagination. But the scientist’s tardy education in the facts of hypnotism has recently given him an apperceiving mass for phenomena of this order, and he consequently now allows that the healings may exist, provided you expressly call them effects of <span class="tei tei-q">“suggestion.”</span> Even the stigmata of the cross on Saint Francis’s hands and feet may on these terms not be a fable. Similarly, the time-honored phenomenon of diabolical possession is on the point of being admitted by the scientist as a fact, now that he has the name of <span class="tei tei-q">“hystero-demonopathy”</span> by which to apperceive it. No one can foresee just how far this legitimation of occultist phenomena under newly found scientist titles may proceed⁠—even <span class="tei tei-q">“prophecy,”</span> even <span class="tei tei-q">“levitation,”</span> might creep into the pale.</p>
						<p>Thus the divorce between scientist facts and religious facts may not necessarily be as eternal as it at first sight seems, nor the personalism and romanticism of the world, as they appeared to primitive thinking, be matters so irrevocably outgrown. The final human opinion may, in short, in some manner now impossible to foresee, revert to the more personal style, just as any path of progress may follow a spiral rather than a straight line. If this were so, the rigorously impersonal view of science might one day appear as having been a temporarily useful eccentricity rather than the definitively triumphant position which the sectarian scientist at present so confidently announces it to be.</p>

						<p>When I read in a religious paper words like these: <span class="tei tei-q">“Perhaps the best thing we can say of God is that he is <span class="tei tei-hi">the Inevitable Inference</span>,”</span> I recognize the tendency to let religion evaporate in intellectual terms. Would martyrs have sung in the flames for a mere inference, however inevitable it might be? Original religious men, like Saint Francis, Luther, Behmen, have usually been enemies of the intellect’s pretension to meddle with religious things. Yet the intellect, everywhere invasive, shows everywhere its shallowing effect. See how the ancient spirit of Methodism evaporates under those wonderfully able rationalistic booklets (which every one should read) of a philosopher like Professor Bowne (The Christian Revelation, The Christian Life, The Atonement: Cincinnati and New York, 1898, 1899, 1900). See the positively expulsive purpose of philosophy properly so called:⁠—</p>
						<p><span class="tei tei-q">“Religion,”</span> writes M. Vacherot (La Religion, Paris, 1869, <abbr>pp.</abbr> 313, 436, et passim), <span class="tei tei-q">“answers to a transient state or condition, not to a permanent determination of human nature, being merely an expression of that stage of the human mind which is dominated by the imagination.⁠ ⁠… Christianity has but a single possible final heir to its estate, and that is scientific philosophy.”</span></p>
						<p>In a still more radical vein, Professor Ribot (Psychologie des Sentiments, <abbr>p.</abbr> 310) describes the evaporation of religion. He sums it up in a single formula⁠—the ever-growing predominance of the rational intellectual element, with the gradual fading out of the emotional element, this latter tending to enter into the group of purely intellectual sentiments. <span class="tei tei-q">“Of religious sentiment properly so called, nothing survives at last save a vague respect for the unknowable <span class="tei tei-hi">x</span> which is a last relic of the fear, and a certain attraction towards the ideal, which is a relic of the love, that characterized the earlier periods of religious growth. To state this more simply, <em class="tei tei-emph">religion tends to turn into religious philosophy</em>.⁠—These are psychologically entirely different things, the one being a theoretic construction of ratiocination, whereas the other is the living work of a group of persons, or of a great inspired leader, calling into play the entire thinking and feeling organism of man.”</span></p>
						<p>I find the same failure to recognize that the stronghold of religion lies in individuality in attempts like those of Professor Baldwin (Mental Development, Social and Ethical Interpretations, ch. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">x</span>.) and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> H.

						<p>Example: Henri Perreyve writes to Gratry: <span class="tei tei-q">“I do not know how to deal with the happiness which you aroused in me this morning. It overwhelms me; I want to <em class="tei tei-emph">do</em> something, yet I can do nothing and am fit for nothing.⁠ ⁠… I would fain do <em class="tei tei-emph">great things</em>.”</span> Again, after an inspiring interview, he writes: <span class="tei tei-q">“I went homewards, intoxicated with joy, hope, and strength. I wanted to feed upon my happiness in solitude, far from all men. It was late; but, unheeding that, I took a mountain path and went on like a madman, looking at the heavens, regardless of earth. Suddenly an instinct made me draw hastily back⁠—I was on the very edge of a precipice, one step more and I must have fallen. I took fright and gave up my nocturnal promenade.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi">A. Gratry</span>: Henri Perreyve, London, 1872, <abbr>pp.</abbr> 92, 89.</p>
						<p>This primacy, in the faith-state, of vague expansive impulse over direction is well expressed in Walt Whitman’s lines (Leaves of Grass, 1872, <abbr>p.</abbr> 190):⁠—</p>
						<p>
							<span class="tei tei-q">“O to confront night, storms, hunger, ridicule, accidents, rebuffs, as the trees and animals do.⁠ ⁠…<br/> Dear Camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me, and still urge you, without the least idea what is our destination,<br/> Or whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quell’d and defeated.”</span>
						</p>
						<p>This readiness for great things, and this sense that the world by its importance, wonderfulness, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, is apt for their production, would seem to be the undifferentiated germ of all the higher faiths. Trust in our own dreams of ambition, or in our country’s expansive destinies, and faith in the providence of God, all have their source in that onrush of our sanguine impulses, and in that sense of the exceedingness of the possible over the real.</p>

Compare my paper: <span class="tei tei-q">“Frederic Myers’s Services to Psychology,”</span> in the said Proceedings, part <span epub:type="z3998:roman">xlii</span>., May, 1901.<a href="#noteref_352" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

						<p>One more expression of this belief, to increase the reader’s familiarity with the notion of it:⁠—</p>
						<p><span class="tei tei-q">“If this room is full of darkness for thousands of years, and you come in and begin to weep and wail, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Oh, the darkness,’</span> will the darkness vanish? Bring the light in, strike a match, and light comes in a moment. So what good will it do you to think all your lives, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Oh, I have done evil, I have made many mistakes’</span>? It requires no ghost to tell us that. Bring in the light, and the evil goes in a moment. Strengthen the real nature, build up yourselves, the effulgent, the resplendent, the ever pure, call that up in every one whom you see. I wish that every one of us had come to such a state that even when we see the vilest of human beings we can see the God within, and instead of condemning, say, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Rise, thou effulgent One, rise thou who art always pure, rise thou birthless and deathless, rise almighty, and manifest your nature.’</span>⁠ ⁠… This is the highest prayer that the Advaita teaches. This is the one prayer: remembering our nature.”</span>⁠ ⁠… <span class="tei tei-q">“Why does man go out to look for a God?⁠ ⁠… It is your own heart beating, and you did not know, you were mistaking it for something external. He, nearest of the near, my own self, the reality of my own life, my body and my soul.⁠—I am Thee and Thou art Me. That is your own nature. Assert it, manifest it. Not to become pure, you are pure already. You are not to be perfect, you are that already. Every good thought which you think or act upon is simply tearing the veil, as it were, and the purity, the Infinity, the God behind, manifests itself⁠—the eternal Subject of everything, the eternal Witness in this universe, your own Self. Knowledge is, as it were, a lower step, a degradation. We are It already; how to know It?”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi">Swami Vivekananda</span>: Addresses, No. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XII</span>., Practical Vedanta, part <span epub:type="z3998:roman">iv</span>. <abbr>pp.</abbr> 172, 174, London, 1897; and Lectures, The Real and the Apparent Man, <abbr>p.</abbr> 24, abridged.</p>

						<p>For instance, here is a case where a person exposed from her birth to Christian ideas had to wait till they came to her clad in spiritistic formulas before the saving experience set in:⁠—</p>
						<p><span class="tei tei-q">“For myself I can say that spiritualism has saved me. It was revealed to me at a critical moment of my life, and without it I don’t know what I should have done. It has taught me to detach myself from worldly things and to place my hope in things to come. Through it I have learned to see in all men, even in those most criminal, even in those from whom I have most suffered, undeveloped brothers to whom I owed assistance, love, and forgiveness. I have learned that I must lose my temper over nothing, despise no one, and pray for all. Most of all I have learned to pray! And although I have still much to learn in this domain, prayer ever brings me more strength, consolation, and comfort. I feel more than ever that I have only made a few steps on the long road of progress; but I look at its length without dismay, for I have confidence that the day will come when all my efforts shall be rewarded. So Spiritualism has a great place in my life, indeed it holds the first place there.”</span> Flournoy Collection.</p>

						<p>That the transaction of opening ourselves, otherwise called prayer, is a perfectly definite one for certain persons, appears abundantly in the preceding lectures. I append another concrete example to reinforce the impression on the reader’s mind:⁠—</p>
						<p><span class="tei tei-q">“Man can learn to transcend these limitations [of finite thought] and draw power and wisdom at will.⁠ ⁠… The divine presence is known through experience. The turning to a higher plane is a distinct act of consciousness. It is not a vague, twilight or semiconscious experience. It is not an ecstasy; it is not a trance. It is not superconsciousness in the Vedantic sense. It is not due to self-hypnotization. It is a perfectly calm, sane, sound, rational, commonsense shifting of consciousness from the phenomena of sense-perception to the phenomena of seership, from the thought of self to a distinctively higher realm.⁠ ⁠… For example, if the lower self be nervous, anxious, tense, one can in a few moments compel it to be calm. This is not done by a word simply. Again I say, it is not hypnotism. It is by the exercise of power. One feels the spirit of peace as definitely as heat is perceived on a hot summer day. The power can be as surely used as the sun’s rays can be focused and made to do work, to set fire to wood.”</span> The Higher Law, <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">iv</span>. <abbr>pp.</abbr> 4, 6, Boston, August, 1901.</p>

					<p>Transcendentalists are fond of the term <span class="tei tei-q">“Over-soul,”</span> but as a rule they use it in an intellectualist sense, as meaning only a medium of communion. <span class="tei tei-q">“God”</span> is a causal agent as well as a medium of communion, and that is the aspect which I wish to emphasize.<a href="#noteref_359" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Transcendental idealism, of course, insists that its ideal world makes <em class="tei tei-emph">this</em> difference, that facts <em class="tei tei-emph">exist</em>. We owe it to the Absolute that we have a world of fact at all. <span class="tei tei-q">“A world”</span> of fact!⁠—that exactly is the trouble. An entire world is the smallest unit with which the Absolute can work, whereas to our finite minds work for the better ought to be done within this world, setting in at single points. Our difficulties and our ideals are all piecemeal affairs, but the Absolute can do no piecework for us; so that all the interests which our poor souls compass raise their heads too late. We should have spoken earlier, prayed for another world absolutely, before this world was born. It is strange, I have heard a friend say, to see this blind corner into which Christian thought has worked itself at last, with its God who can raise no particular weight whatever, who can help us with no private burden, and who is on the side of our enemies as much as he is on our own. Odd evolution from the God of David’s psalms!<a href="#noteref_360" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
