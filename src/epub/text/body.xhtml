<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This book would
        never have been written had I not been honored with an appointment as
        Gifford Lecturer on Natural Religion at the University of Edinburgh.
        In casting about me for subjects of the two courses of ten lectures
        each for which I thus became responsible, it seemed to me that the
        first course might well be a descriptive one on <span class="tei tei-q">“Man's Religious Appetites,”</span> and the second a
        metaphysical one on <span class="tei tei-q">“Their Satisfaction
        through Philosophy.”</span> But the unexpected growth of the
        psychological matter as I came to write it out has resulted in the
        second subject being postponed entirely, and the description of man's
        religious constitution now fills the twenty lectures. In Lecture
        <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Lecture_XX">XX</a> I have suggested
        rather than stated my own philosophic conclusions, and the reader who
        desires immediately to know them should turn to pages <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Pg511">511-519</a>, and to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Postscript”</span> of the book. I hope to be able at
        some later day to express them in more explicit form.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In my belief that
        a large acquaintance with particulars often makes us wiser than the
        possession of abstract formulas, however deep, I have loaded the
        lectures with concrete examples, and I have chosen these among the
        extremer expressions of the religious temperament. To some readers I
        may consequently seem, before they get beyond the middle of the book,
        to offer a caricature of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg
        vi]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgvi"/> the
        subject. Such convulsions of piety, they will say, are not sane. If,
        however, they will have the patience to read to the end, I believe
        that this unfavorable impression will disappear; for I there combine
        the religious impulses with other principles of common sense which
        serve as correctives of exaggeration, and allow the individual reader
        to draw as moderate conclusions as he will.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My thanks for help
        in writing these lectures are due to Edwin D. Starbuck, of Stanford
        University, who made over to me his large collection of manuscript
        material; to Henry W. Rankin, of East Northfield, a friend unseen but
        proved, to whom I owe precious information; to Theodore Flournoy, of
        Geneva, to Canning Schiller, of Oxford, and to my colleague Benjamin
        Rand, for documents; to my colleague Dickinson S. Miller, and to my
        friends, Thomas Wren Ward, of New York, and Wincenty Lutoslawski,
        late of Cracow, for important suggestions and advice. Finally, to
        conversations with the lamented Thomas Davidson and to the use of his
        books, at Glenmore, above Keene Valley, I owe more obligations than I
        can well express.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is with no
        small amount of trepidation that I take my place behind this desk,
        and face this learned audience. To us Americans, the experience of
        receiving instruction from the living voice, as well as from the
        books, of European scholars, is very familiar. At my own University
        of Harvard, not a winter passes without its harvest, large or small,
        of lectures from Scottish, English, French, or German representatives
        of the science or literature of their respective countries whom we
        have either induced to cross the ocean to address us, or captured on
        the wing as they were visiting our land. It seems the natural thing
        for us to listen whilst the Europeans talk. The contrary habit, of
        talking whilst the Europeans listen, we have not yet acquired; and in
        him who first makes the adventure it begets a certain sense of
        apology being due for so presumptuous an act. Particularly must this
        be the case on a soil as sacred to the American imagination as that
        of Edinburgh. The glories of the philosophic chair of this university
        were deeply impressed on my imagination in boyhood. Professor
        Fraser's Essays in Philosophy, then just published, was the first
        philosophic book I ever looked into, and I well remember the
        awe-struck feeling I received from the account of Sir William
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg002"/> Hamilton's class-room therein
        contained. Hamilton's own lectures were the first philosophic
        writings I ever forced myself to study, and after that I was immersed
        in Dugald Stewart and Thomas Brown. Such juvenile emotions of
        reverence never get outgrown; and I confess that to find my humble
        self promoted from my native wilderness to be actually for the time
        an official here, and transmuted into a colleague of these
        illustrious names, carries with it a sense of dreamland quite as much
        as of reality.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But since I have
        received the honor of this appointment I have felt that it would
        never do to decline. The academic career also has its heroic
        obligations, so I stand here without further deprecatory words. Let
        me say only this, that now that the current, here and at Aberdeen,
        has begun to run from west to east, I hope it may continue to do so.
        As the years go by, I hope that many of my countrymen may be asked to
        lecture in the Scottish universities, changing places with Scotsmen
        lecturing in the United States; I hope that our people may become in
        all these higher matters even as one people; and that the peculiar
        philosophic temperament, as well as the peculiar political
        temperament, that goes with our English speech may more and more
        pervade and influence the world.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards the
        manner in which I shall have to administer this lectureship, I am
        neither a theologian, nor a scholar learned in the history of
        religions, nor an anthropologist. Psychology is the only branch of
        learning in which I am particularly versed. To the psychologist the
        religious propensities of man must be at least as interesting as any
        other of the facts pertaining to his mental constitution. It would
        seem, therefore, that, as a psychologist, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg003"/> the natural thing for me would be to invite you
        to a descriptive survey of those religious propensities.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the inquiry be
        psychological, not religious institutions, but rather religious
        feelings and religious impulses must be its subject, and I must
        confine myself to those more developed subjective phenomena recorded
        in literature produced by articulate and fully self-conscious men, in
        works of piety and autobiography. Interesting as the origins and
        early stages of a subject always are, yet when one seeks earnestly
        for its full significance, one must always look to its more
        completely evolved and perfect forms. It follows from this that the
        documents that will most concern us will be those of the men who were
        most accomplished in the religious life and best able to give an
        intelligible account of their ideas and motives. These men, of
        course, are either comparatively modern writers, or else such earlier
        ones as have become religious classics. The <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">documents
        humains</span></span> which we shall find most instructive need not
        then be sought for in the haunts of special erudition—they lie along
        the beaten highway; and this circumstance, which flows so naturally
        from the character of our problem, suits admirably also your
        lecturer's lack of special theological learning. I may take my
        citations, my sentences and paragraphs of personal confession, from
        books that most of you at some time will have had already in your
        hands, and yet this will be no detriment to the value of my
        conclusions. It is true that some more adventurous reader and
        investigator, lecturing here in future, may unearth from the shelves
        of libraries documents that will make a more delectable and curious
        entertainment to listen to than mine. Yet I doubt whether he will
        necessarily, by his control of so much more out-of-the-way material,
        get much closer to the essence of the matter in hand.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg004"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question, What
        are the religious propensities? and the question, What is their
        philosophic significance? are two entirely different orders of
        question from the logical point of view; and, as a failure to
        recognize this fact distinctly may breed confusion, I wish to insist
        upon the point a little before we enter into the documents and
        materials to which I have referred.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In recent books on
        logic, distinction is made between two orders of inquiry concerning
        anything. First, what is the nature of it? how did it come about?
        what is its constitution, origin, and history? And second, What is
        its importance, meaning, or significance, now that it is once here?
        The answer to the one question is given in an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">existential
        judgment</span></em> or proposition. The answer to the other is a
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proposition
        of value</span></em>, what the Germans call a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Werthurtheil</span></span>, or what we may, if
        we like, denominate a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spiritual judgment</span></em>. Neither judgment
        can be deduced immediately from the other. They proceed from diverse
        intellectual preoccupations, and the mind combines them only by
        making them first separately, and then adding them together.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the matter of
        religions it is particularly easy to distinguish the two orders of
        question. Every religious phenomenon has its history and its
        derivation from natural antecedents. What is nowadays called the
        higher criticism of the Bible is only a study of the Bible from this
        existential point of view, neglected too much by the earlier church.
        Under just what biographic conditions did the sacred writers bring
        forth their various contributions to the holy volume? And what had
        they exactly in their several individual minds, when they delivered
        their utterances? These are manifestly questions of historical fact,
        and one does not see how the answer to them can decide offhand the
        still further question: of what use <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg005"/> should such a volume, with its manner of coming
        into existence so defined, be to us as a guide to life and a
        revelation? To answer this other question we must have already in our
        mind some sort of a general theory as to what the peculiarities in a
        thing should be which give it value for purposes of revelation; and
        this theory itself would be what I just called a spiritual judgment.
        Combining it with our existential judgment, we might indeed deduce
        another spiritual judgment as to the Bible's worth. Thus if our
        theory of revelation-value were to affirm that any book, to possess
        it, must have been composed automatically or not by the free caprice
        of the writer, or that it must exhibit no scientific and historic
        errors and express no local or personal passions, the Bible would
        probably fare ill at our hands. But if, on the other hand, our theory
        should allow that a book may well be a revelation in spite of errors
        and passions and deliberate human composition, if only it be a true
        record of the inner experiences of great-souled persons wrestling
        with the crises of their fate, then the verdict would be much more
        favorable. You see that the existential facts by themselves are
        insufficient for determining the value; and the best adepts of the
        higher criticism accordingly never confound the existential with the
        spiritual problem. With the same conclusions of fact before them,
        some take one view, and some another, of the Bible's value as a
        revelation, according as their spiritual judgment as to the
        foundation of values differs.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I make these
        general remarks about the two sorts of judgment, because there are
        many religious persons—some of you now present, possibly, are among
        them—who do not yet make a working use of the distinction, and who
        may therefore feel at first a little startled at <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg006"/> the purely existential point of view from
        which in the following lectures the phenomena of religious experience
        must be considered. When I handle them biologically and
        psychologically as if they were mere curious facts of individual
        history, some of you may think it a degradation of so sublime a
        subject, and may even suspect me, until my purpose gets more fully
        expressed, of deliberately seeking to discredit the religious side of
        life.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such a result is
        of course absolutely alien to my intention; and since such a
        prejudice on your part would seriously obstruct the due effect of
        much of what I have to relate, I will devote a few more words to the
        point.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There can be no
        doubt that as a matter of fact a religious life, exclusively pursued,
        does tend to make the person exceptional and eccentric. I speak not
        now of your ordinary religious believer, who follows the conventional
        observances of his country, whether it be Buddhist, Christian, or
        Mohammedan. His religion has been made for him by others,
        communicated to him by tradition, determined to fixed forms by
        imitation, and retained by habit. It would profit us little to study
        this second-hand religious life. We must make search rather for the
        original experiences which were the pattern-setters to all this mass
        of suggested feeling and imitated conduct. These experiences we can
        only find in individuals for whom religion exists not as a dull
        habit, but as an acute fever rather. But such individuals are
        <span class="tei tei-q">“geniuses”</span> in the religious line; and
        like many other geniuses who have brought forth fruits effective
        enough for commemoration in the pages of biography, such religious
        geniuses have often shown symptoms of nervous instability. Even more
        perhaps than other kinds of genius, religious leaders have been
        subject to abnormal psychical visitations. Invariably they have been
        creatures of exalted emotional sensibility. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg007"/> Often they have led a discordant inner life,
        and had melancholy during a part of their career. They have known no
        measure, been liable to obsessions and fixed ideas; and frequently
        they have fallen into trances, heard voices, seen visions, and
        presented all sorts of peculiarities which are ordinarily classed as
        pathological. Often, moreover, these pathological features in their
        career have helped to give them their religious authority and
        influence.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If you ask for a
        concrete example, there can be no better one than is furnished by the
        person of George Fox. The Quaker religion which he founded is
        something which it is impossible to overpraise. In a day of shams, it
        was a religion of veracity rooted in spiritual inwardness, and a
        return to something more like the original gospel truth than men had
        ever known in England. So far as our Christian sects to-day are
        evolving into liberality, they are simply reverting in essence to the
        position which Fox and the early Quakers so long ago assumed. No one
        can pretend for a moment that in point of spiritual sagacity and
        capacity, Fox's mind was unsound. Every one who confronted him
        personally, from Oliver Cromwell down to county magistrates and
        jailers, seems to have acknowledged his superior power. Yet from the
        point of view of his nervous constitution, Fox was a psychopath or
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">détraqué</span></span> of the deepest dye. His
        Journal abounds in entries of this sort:—</p>

        Immediately the word of the Lord came to me, that I must go thither.
        Being come to the house we were going to, I wished the friends to
        walk into the house, saying nothing to them of whither I was to go.
        As soon as they were gone I stept away,</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg008"/><span style="font-size: 90%">and went by
        my eye over hedge and ditch till I came within a mile of Lichfield;
        where, in a great field, shepherds were keeping their sheep. Then was
        I commanded by the Lord to pull off my shoes. I stood still, for it
        was winter: but the word of the Lord was like a fire in me. So I put
        off my shoes, and left them with the shepherds; and the poor
        shepherds trembled, and were astonished. Then I walked on about a
        mile, and as soon as I was got within the city, the word of the Lord
        came to me again, saying: Cry,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Wo to the bloody city of
        Lichfield!</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">So I went up and down the streets,
        crying with a loud voice, Wo to the bloody city of Lichfield! It
        being market day, I went into the market-place, and to and fro in the
        several parts of it, and made stands, crying as before, Wo to the
        bloody city of Lichfield! And no one laid hands on me. As I went thus
        crying through the streets, there seemed to me to be a channel of
        blood running down the streets, and the market-place appeared like a
        pool of blood. When I had declared what was upon me, and felt myself
        clear, I went out of the town in peace; and returning to the
        shepherds gave them some money, and took my shoes of them again. But
        the fire of the Lord was so on my feet, and all over me, that I did
        not matter to put on my shoes again, and was at a stand whether I
        should or no, till I felt freedom from the Lord so to do: then, after
        I had washed my feet, I put on my shoes again. After this a deep
        consideration came upon me, for what reason I should be sent to cry
        against that city, and call it The bloody city! For though the
        parliament had the minister one while, and the king another, and much
        blood had been shed in the town during the wars between them, yet
        there was no more than had befallen many other places. But afterwards
        I came to understand, that in the Emperor Diocletian's time a
        thousand Christians were martyr'd in Lichfield. So I was to go,
        without my shoes, through the channel of their blood, and into the
        pool of their blood in the market-place, that I might raise up the
        memorial of the blood of those martyrs, which had been shed above a
        thousand years before, and lay cold in their streets. So the sense of
        this blood was upon me, and I obeyed the word of the
        Lord.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bent as we are on
        studying religion's existential conditions, we cannot possibly ignore
        these pathological aspects of the subject. We must describe and name
        them just as if they occurred in non-religious men. It is true that
        we instinctively recoil from seeing an object to which our emotions
        and affections are committed handled by the intellect as any other
        object is handled. The first thing the intellect does with an object
        is to class it along with something else. But any object that is
        infinitely important to us and awakens our devotion feels to us also
        as if it must be <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sui generis</span></span> and unique. Probably a
        crab would be filled with a sense of personal outrage if it could
        hear us class it without ado or apology as a crustacean, and thus
        dispose of it. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am no such thing,”</span>
        it would say; <span class="tei tei-q">“I am <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">myself</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">myself</span></span> alone.”</span></p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next thing the
        intellect does is to lay bare the causes in which the thing
        originates. Spinoza says: <span class="tei tei-q">“I will analyze the
        actions and appetites of men as if it were a question of lines, of
        planes, and of solids.”</span> And elsewhere he remarks that he will
        consider our passions and their properties with the same eye with
        which he looks on all other natural things, since the consequences of
        our affections flow from their nature with the same necessity as it
        results from the nature of a triangle that its three angles should be
        equal to two right angles. Similarly M. Taine, in the introduction to
        his history of English literature, has written: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whether facts be moral or physical, it makes no matter.
        They always have their causes. There are causes for ambition,
        courage, veracity, just as there are for digestion, muscular
        movement, animal heat. Vice and virtue are products like vitriol and
        sugar.”</span> When we read such proclamations of the intellect bent
        on showing the existential conditions of absolutely <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg010"/> everything, we feel—quite apart from our
        legitimate impatience at the somewhat ridiculous swagger of the
        program, in view of what the authors are actually able to
        perform—menaced and negated in the springs of our innermost life.
        Such cold-blooded assimilations threaten, we think, to undo our
        soul's vital secrets, as if the same breath which should succeed in
        explaining their origin would simultaneously explain away their
        significance, and make them appear of no more preciousness, either,
        than the useful groceries of which M. Taine speaks.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps the
        commonest expression of this assumption that spiritual value is
        undone if lowly origin be asserted is seen in those comments which
        unsentimental people so often pass on their more sentimental
        acquaintances. Alfred believes in immortality so strongly because his
        temperament is so emotional. Fanny's extraordinary conscientiousness
        is merely a matter of over-instigated nerves. William's melancholy
        about the universe is due to bad digestion—probably his liver is
        torpid. Eliza's delight in her church is a symptom of her hysterical
        constitution. Peter would be less troubled about his soul if he would
        take more exercise in the open air, etc. A more fully developed
        example of the same kind of reasoning is the fashion, quite common
        nowadays among certain writers, of criticising the religious emotions
        by showing a connection between them and the sexual life. Conversion
        is a crisis of puberty and adolescence. The macerations of saints,
        and the devotion of missionaries, are only instances of the parental
        instinct of self-sacrifice gone astray. For the hysterical nun,
        starving for natural life, Christ is but an imaginary substitute for
        a more earthly object of affection. And the like.<a href="#note_1" id="noteref_1" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg011"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are surely all
        familiar in a general way with this method of discrediting states of
        mind for which we have <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg
        012]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg012"/> an
        antipathy. We all use it to some degree in criticising persons whose
        states of mind we regard as overstrained. But when other people
        criticise our own more exalted soul-flights by calling them
        <span class="tei tei-q">“nothing but”</span> expressions of our
        organic disposition, we feel outraged and hurt, for we know that,
        whatever be our organism's peculiarities, our mental states have
        their substantive value as revelations <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg013"/> of the living truth; and we wish that all this
        medical materialism could be made to hold its tongue.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Medical
        materialism seems indeed a good appellation for the too simple-minded
        system of thought which we are considering. Medical materialism
        finishes up Saint Paul by calling his vision on the road to Damascus
        a discharging lesion of the occipital cortex, he being an epileptic.
        It snuffs out Saint Teresa as an hysteric, Saint Francis of Assisi as
        an hereditary degenerate. George Fox's discontent with the shams of
        his age, and his pining for spiritual veracity, it treats as a
        symptom of a disordered colon. Carlyle's organ-tones of misery it
        accounts for by a gastro-duodenal catarrh. All such mental
        over-tensions, it says, are, when you come to the bottom of the
        matter, mere affairs of diathesis (auto-intoxications most probably),
        due to the perverted action of various glands which physiology will
        yet discover.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And medical
        materialism then thinks that the spiritual authority of all such
        personages is successfully undermined.<a href="#note_2" id="noteref_2" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us ourselves
        look at the matter in the largest possible way. Modern psychology,
        finding definite psycho-physical connections to hold good, assumes as
        a convenient hypothesis that the dependence of mental states upon
        bodily conditions must be thorough-going and complete. If we adopt
        the assumption, then of course what medical materialism insists on
        must be true in a general way, if not in every detail: Saint Paul
        certainly had once an epileptoid, if not an epileptic seizure; George
        Fox was an hereditary degenerate; Carlyle was undoubtedly
        auto-intoxicated by some organ or other, no matter which,—and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg014"/> the rest. But now, I ask you,
        how can such an existential account of facts of mental history decide
        in one way or another upon their spiritual significance? According to
        the general postulate of psychology just referred to, there is not a
        single one of our states of mind, high or low, healthy or morbid,
        that has not some organic process as its condition. Scientific
        theories are organically conditioned just as much as religious
        emotions are; and if we only knew the facts intimately enough, we
        should doubtless see <span class="tei tei-q">“the liver”</span>
        determining the dicta of the sturdy atheist as decisively as it does
        those of the Methodist under conviction anxious about his soul. When
        it alters in one way the blood that percolates it, we get the
        methodist, when in another way, we get the atheist form of mind. So
        of all our raptures and our drynesses, our longings and pantings, our
        questions and beliefs. They are equally organically founded, be they
        of religious or of non-religious content.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To plead the
        organic causation of a religious state of mind, then, in refutation
        of its claim to possess superior spiritual value, is quite illogical
        and arbitrary, unless one have already worked out in advance some
        psycho-physical theory connecting spiritual values in general with
        determinate sorts of physiological change. Otherwise none of our
        thoughts and feelings, not even our scientific doctrines, not even
        our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dis</span></em>-beliefs, could retain any value
        as revelations of the truth, for every one of them without exception
        flows from the state of their possessor's body at the time.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is needless to
        say that medical materialism draws in point of fact no such sweeping
        skeptical conclusion. It is sure, just as every simple man is sure,
        that some states of mind are inwardly superior to others, and reveal
        to us more truth, and in this it simply makes use of an ordinary
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg015"/> spiritual judgment. It has no
        physiological theory of the production of these its favorite states,
        by which it may accredit them; and its attempt to discredit the
        states which it dislikes, by vaguely associating them with nerves and
        liver, and connecting them with names connoting bodily affliction, is
        altogether illogical and inconsistent.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us play fair
        in this whole matter, and be quite candid with ourselves and with the
        facts. When we think certain states of mind superior to others, is it
        ever because of what we know concerning their organic antecedents?
        No! it is always for two entirely different reasons. It is either
        because we take an immediate delight in them; or else it is because
        we believe them to bring us good consequential fruits for life. When
        we speak disparagingly of <span class="tei tei-q">“feverish
        fancies,”</span> surely the fever-process as such is not the ground
        of our disesteem—for aught we know to the contrary, 103° or 104°
        Fahrenheit might be a much more favorable temperature for truths to
        germinate and sprout in, than the more ordinary blood-heat of 97 or
        98 degrees. It is either the disagreeableness itself of the fancies,
        or their inability to bear the criticisms of the convalescent hour.
        When we praise the thoughts which health brings, health's peculiar
        chemical metabolisms have nothing to do with determining our
        judgment. We know in fact almost nothing about these metabolisms. It
        is the character of inner happiness in the thoughts which stamps them
        as good, or else their consistency with our other opinions and their
        serviceability for our needs, which make them pass for true in our
        esteem.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now the more
        intrinsic and the more remote of these criteria do not always hang
        together. Inner happiness and serviceability do not always agree.
        What immediately feels most <span class="tei tei-q">“good”</span> is
        not always most <span class="tei tei-q">“true,”</span> when
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg016"/> measured by the verdict of the
        rest of experience. The difference between Philip drunk and Philip
        sober is the classic instance in corroboration. If merely
        <span class="tei tei-q">“feeling good”</span> could decide,
        drunkenness would be the supremely valid human experience. But its
        revelations, however acutely satisfying at the moment, are inserted
        into an environment which refuses to bear them out for any length of
        time. The consequence of this discrepancy of the two criteria is the
        uncertainty which still prevails over so many of our spiritual
        judgments. There are moments of sentimental and mystical
        experience—we shall hereafter hear much of them—that carry an
        enormous sense of inner authority and illumination with them when
        they come. But they come seldom, and they do not come to every one;
        and the rest of life makes either no connection with them, or tends
        to contradict them more than it confirms them. Some persons follow
        more the voice of the moment in these cases, some prefer to be guided
        by the average results. Hence the sad discordancy of so many of the
        spiritual judgments of human beings; a discordancy which will be
        brought home to us acutely enough before these lectures end.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is, however, a
        discordancy that can never be resolved by any merely medical test. A
        good example of the impossibility of holding strictly to the medical
        tests is seen in the theory of the pathological causation of genius
        promulgated by recent authors. <span class="tei tei-q">“Genius,”</span> said Dr. Moreau, <span class="tei tei-q">“is but one of the many branches of the neuropathic
        tree.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Genius,”</span> says Dr.
        Lombroso, <span class="tei tei-q">“is a symptom of hereditary
        degeneration of the epileptoid variety, and is allied to moral
        insanity.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Whenever a man's
        life,”</span> writes Mr. Nisbet, <span class="tei tei-q">“is at once
        sufficiently illustrious and recorded with sufficient fullness to be
        a subject of profitable <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg
        017]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg017"/>
        study, he inevitably falls into the morbid category.... And it is
        worthy of remark that, as a rule, the greater the genius, the greater
        the unsoundness.”</span><a href="#note_3" id="noteref_3" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now do these
        authors, after having succeeded in establishing to their own
        satisfaction that the works of genius are fruits of disease,
        consistently proceed thereupon to impugn the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">value</span></em> of
        the fruits? Do they deduce a new spiritual judgment from their new
        doctrine of existential conditions? Do they frankly forbid us to
        admire the productions of genius from now onwards? and say outright
        that no neuropath can ever be a revealer of new truth?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No! their
        immediate spiritual instincts are too strong for them here, and hold
        their own against inferences which, in mere love of logical
        consistency, medical materialism ought to be only too glad to draw.
        One disciple of the school, indeed, has striven to impugn the value
        of works of genius in a wholesale way (such works of contemporary
        art, namely, as he himself is unable to enjoy, and they are many) by
        using medical arguments.<a href="#note_4" id="noteref_4" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> But for
        the most part the masterpieces are left unchallenged; and the medical
        line of attack either confines itself to such secular productions as
        every one admits to be intrinsically eccentric, or else addresses
        itself exclusively to religious manifestations. And then it is
        because the religious manifestations have been already condemned
        because the critic dislikes them on internal or spiritual
        grounds.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the natural
        sciences and industrial arts it never occurs to any one to try to
        refute opinions by showing up their author's neurotic constitution.
        Opinions here are invariably tested by logic and by experiment, no
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg018"/> matter what may be their
        author's neurological type. It should be no otherwise with religious
        opinions. Their value can only be ascertained by spiritual judgments
        directly passed upon them, judgments based on our own immediate
        feeling primarily; and secondarily on what we can ascertain of their
        experiential relations to our moral needs and to the rest of what we
        hold as true.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Immediate
        luminousness</span></em>, in short, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophical
        reasonableness</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral helpfulness</span></em> are the only
        available criteria. Saint Teresa might have had the nervous system of
        the placidest cow, and it would not now save her theology, if the
        trial of the theology by these other tests should show it to be
        contemptible. And conversely if her theology can stand these other
        tests, it will make no difference how hysterical or nervously off her
        balance Saint Teresa may have been when she was with us here
        below.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">You see that at
        bottom we are thrown back upon the general principles by which the
        empirical philosophy has always contended that we must be guided in
        our search for truth. Dogmatic philosophies have sought for tests for
        truth which might dispense us from appealing to the future. Some
        direct mark, by noting which we can be protected immediately and
        absolutely, now and forever, against all mistake—such has been the
        darling dream of philosophic dogmatists. It is clear that the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">origin</span></em> of the truth would be an
        admirable criterion of this sort, if only the various origins could
        be discriminated from one another from this point of view, and the
        history of dogmatic opinion shows that origin has always been a
        favorite test. Origin in immediate intuition; origin in pontifical
        authority; origin in supernatural revelation, as by vision, hearing,
        or unaccountable impression; origin in direct <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg019"/> possession by a higher spirit, expressing
        itself in prophecy and warning; origin in automatic utterance
        generally,—these origins have been stock warrants for the truth of
        one opinion after another which we find represented in religious
        history. The medical materialists are therefore only so many belated
        dogmatists, neatly turning the tables on their predecessors by using
        the criterion of origin in a destructive instead of an accreditive
        way.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They are effective
        with their talk of pathological origin only so long as supernatural
        origin is pleaded by the other side, and nothing but the argument
        from origin is under discussion. But the argument from origin has
        seldom been used alone, for it is too obviously insufficient. Dr.
        Maudsley is perhaps the cleverest of the rebutters of supernatural
        religion on grounds of origin. Yet he finds himself forced to
        write:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What right have we to believe Nature under any
        obligation to do her work by means of complete minds only? She may
        find an incomplete mind a more suitable instrument for a particular
        purpose. It is the work that is done, and the quality in the worker
        by which it was done, that is alone of moment; and it may be no great
        matter from a cosmical standpoint, if in other qualities of character
        he was singularly defective—if indeed he were hypocrite, adulterer,
        eccentric, or lunatic.... Home we come again, then, to the old and
        last resort of certitude,—namely the common assent of mankind, or of
        the competent by instruction and training among
        mankind.”</span><a href="#note_5" id="noteref_5" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a></p>

        origin have also been forced to use in the end. Among the visions and
        messages some have always been too patently silly, among the trances
        and convulsive seizures some have been too fruitless for conduct and
        character, to pass themselves off as significant, still less as
        divine. In the history of Christian mysticism the problem how to
        discriminate between such messages and experiences as were really
        divine miracles, and such others as the demon in his malice was able
        to counterfeit, thus making the religious person twofold more the
        child of hell he was before, has always been a difficult one to
        solve, needing all the sagacity and experience of the best directors
        of conscience. In the end it had to come to our empiricist criterion:
        By their fruits ye shall know them, not by their roots, Jonathan
        Edwards's Treatise on Religious Affections is an elaborate working
        out of this thesis. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">roots</span></em> of a man's virtue are
        inaccessible to us. No appearances whatever are infallible proofs of
        grace. Our practice is the only sure evidence, even to ourselves,
        that we are genuinely Christians.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I fear I may have
        made a longer excursus than was necessary, and that fewer words would
        have dispelled the uneasiness which may have arisen among some of you
        as I announced my pathological programme. At any rate you must all be
        ready now to judge the religious life by its results exclusively, and
        I shall assume that the bugaboo of morbid origin will scandalize your
        piety no more.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still, you may ask
        me, if its results are to be the ground of our final spiritual
        estimate of a religious phenomenon, why threaten us at all with so
        much existential study of its conditions? Why not simply leave
        pathological questions out?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this I reply in
        two ways: First, I say, irrepressible curiosity imperiously leads one
        on; and I say, secondly, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg
        022]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg022"/>
        that it always leads to a better understanding of a thing's
        significance to consider its exaggerations and perversions, its
        equivalents and substitutes and nearest relatives elsewhere. Not that
        we may thereby swamp the thing in the wholesale condemnation which we
        pass on its inferior congeners, but rather that we may by contrast
        ascertain the more precisely in what its merits consist, by learning
        at the same time to what particular dangers of corruption it may also
        be exposed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Insane conditions
        have this advantage, that they isolate special factors of the mental
        life, and enable us to inspect them unmasked by their more usual
        surroundings. They play the part in mental anatomy which the scalpel
        and the microscope play in the anatomy of the body. To understand a
        thing rightly we need to see it both out of its environment and in
        it, and to have acquaintance with the whole range of its variations.
        The study of hallucinations has in this way been for psychologists
        the key to their comprehension of normal sensation, that of illusions
        has been the key to the right comprehension of perception. Morbid
        impulses and imperative conceptions, <span class="tei tei-q">“fixed
        ideas,”</span> so called, have thrown a flood of light on the
        psychology of the normal will; and obsessions and delusions have
        performed the same service for that of the normal faculty of
        belief.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Similarly, the
        nature of genius has been illuminated by the attempts, of which I
        already made mention, to class it with psychopathical phenomena.
        Borderland insanity, crankiness, insane temperament, loss of mental
        balance, psychopathic degeneration (to use a few of the many synonyms
        by which it has been called), has certain peculiarities and
        liabilities which, when combined with a superior quality of intellect
        in an individual, make it more probable that he will make his mark
        and affect his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg
        023]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg023"/>
        age, than if his temperament were less neurotic. There is of course
        no special affinity between crankiness as such and superior
        intellect,<a href="#note_7" id="noteref_7" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> for most
        psychopaths have feeble intellects, and superior intellects more
        commonly have normal nervous systems. But the psychopathic
        temperament, whatever be the intellect with which it finds itself
        paired, often brings with it ardor and excitability of character. The
        cranky person has extraordinary emotional susceptibility. He is
        liable to fixed ideas and obsessions. His conceptions tend to pass
        immediately into belief and action; and when he gets a new idea, he
        has no rest till he proclaims it, or in some way <span class="tei tei-q">“works it off.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“What
        shall I think of it?”</span> a common person says to himself about a
        vexed question; but in a <span class="tei tei-q">“cranky”</span> mind
        <span class="tei tei-q">“What must I do about it?”</span> is the form
        the question tends to take. In the autobiography of that high-souled
        woman, Mrs. Annie Besant, I read the following passage: <span class="tei tei-q">“Plenty of people wish well to any good cause, but very
        few care to exert themselves to help it, and still fewer will risk
        anything in its support. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Some one ought to
        do it, but why should I?’</span> is the ever reëchoed phrase of
        weak-kneed amiability. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Some one ought to do
        it, so why not I?’</span> is the cry of some earnest servant of man,
        eagerly forward springing to face some perilous duty. Between these
        two sentences lie whole centuries of moral evolution.”</span> True
        enough! and between these two sentences lie also the different
        destinies of the ordinary sluggard and the psychopathic man. Thus,
        when a superior intellect and a psychopathic temperament coalesce—as
        in the endless permutations and combinations of human faculty, they
        are bound to coalesce often enough—in the same individual, we have
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg024"/> the best possible condition
        for the kind of effective genius that gets into the biographical
        dictionaries. Such men do not remain mere critics and understanders
        with their intellect. Their ideas possess them, they inflict them,
        for better or worse, upon their companions or their age. It is they
        who get counted when Messrs Lombroso, Nisbet, and others invoke
        statistics to defend their paradox.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To pass now to
        religious phenomena, take the melancholy which, as we shall see,
        constitutes an essential moment in every complete religious
        evolution. Take the happiness which achieved religious belief
        confers. Take the trance-like states of insight into truth which all
        religious mystics report.<a href="#note_8" id="noteref_8" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> These are
        each and all of them special cases of kinds of human experience of
        much wider scope. Religious melancholy, whatever peculiarities it may
        have <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">quâ</span></span> religious, is at any rate
        melancholy. Religious happiness is happiness. Religious trance is
        trance. And the moment we renounce the absurd notion that a thing is
        exploded away as soon as it is classed with others, or its origin is
        shown; the moment we agree to stand by experimental results and inner
        quality, in judging of values,—who does not see that we are likely to
        ascertain the distinctive significance of religious melancholy and
        happiness, or of religious trances, far better by comparing them as
        conscientiously as we can with other varieties of melancholy,
        happiness, and trance, than by refusing to consider their place in
        any more general series, and treating them as if they were outside of
        nature's order altogether?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I hope that the
        course of these lectures will confirm us in this supposition. As
        regards the psychopathic origin of so many religious phenomena, that
        would not be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg
        025]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg025"/> in
        the least surprising or disconcerting, even were such phenomena
        certified from on high to be the most precious of human experiences.
        No one organism can possibly yield to its owner the whole body of
        truth. Few of us are not in some way infirm, or even diseased; and
        our very infirmities help us unexpectedly. In the psychopathic
        temperament we have the emotionality which is the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sine quâ
        non</span></span> of moral perception; we have the intensity and
        tendency to emphasis which are the essence of practical moral vigor;
        and we have the love of metaphysics and mysticism which carry one's
        interests beyond the surface of the sensible world. What, then, is
        more natural than that this temperament should introduce one to
        regions of religious truth, to corners of the universe, which your
        robust Philistine type of nervous system, forever offering its biceps
        to be felt, thumping its breast, and thanking Heaven that it hasn't a
        single morbid fibre in its composition, would be sure to hide forever
        from its self-satisfied possessors?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If there were such
        a thing as inspiration from a higher realm, it might well be that the
        neurotic temperament would furnish the chief condition of the
        requisite receptivity. And having said thus much, I think that I may
        let the matter of religion and neuroticism drop.</p>

        better, forms what in the slang of pedagogics is termed <span class="tei tei-q">“the apperceiving mass”</span> by which we comprehend
        them. The only novelty that I can imagine this course of lectures to
        possess lies in the breadth of the apperceiving mass. I may succeed
        in discussing religious experiences in a wider context than has been
        usual in university courses.</p>

        Topic.</span></h1>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most books on the
        philosophy of religion try to begin with a precise definition of what
        its essence consists of. Some of these would-be definitions may
        possibly come before us in later portions of this course, and I shall
        not be pedantic enough to enumerate any of them to you now. Meanwhile
        the very fact that they are so many and so different from one another
        is enough to prove that the word <span class="tei tei-q">“religion”</span> cannot stand for any single principle
        or essence, but is rather a collective name. The theorizing mind
        tends always to the over-simplification of its materials. This is the
        root of all that absolutism and one-sided dogmatism by which both
        philosophy and religion have been infested. Let us not fall
        immediately into a one-sided view of our subject, but let us rather
        admit freely at the outset that we may very likely find no one
        essence, but many characters which may alternately be equally
        important in religion. If we should inquire for the essence of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“government,”</span> for example, one man
        might tell us it was authority, another submission, another police,
        another an army, another an assembly, another a system of laws; yet
        all the while it would be true that no concrete government can exist
        without all these things, one of which is more important at one
        moment and others at another. The man who knows governments most
        completely is he who troubles himself least about a definition which
        shall give their essence. Enjoying an intimate acquaintance with all
        their particularities <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg
        027]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg027"/> in
        turn, he would naturally regard an abstract conception in which these
        were unified as a thing more misleading than enlightening. And why
        may not religion be a conception equally complex?<a href="#note_9" id="noteref_9" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a></p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Consider also the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“religious sentiment”</span> which we see
        referred to in so many books, as if it were a single sort of mental
        entity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
        psychologies and in the philosophies of religion, we find the authors
        attempting to specify just what entity it is. One man allies it to
        the feeling of dependence; one makes it a derivative from fear;
        others connect it with the sexual life; others still identify it with
        the feeling of the infinite; and so on. Such different ways of
        conceiving it ought of themselves to arouse doubt as to whether it
        possibly can be one specific thing; and the moment we are willing to
        treat the term <span class="tei tei-q">“religious sentiment”</span>
        as a collective name for the many sentiments which religious objects
        may arouse in alternation, we see that it probably contains nothing
        whatever of a psychologically specific nature. There is religious
        fear, religious love, religious awe, religious joy, and so forth. But
        religious love is only man's natural emotion of love directed to a
        religious object; religious fear is only the ordinary fear of
        commerce, so to speak, the common quaking of the human breast, in so
        far as the notion of divine retribution may arouse it; religious awe
        is the same organic thrill which we feel in a forest at twilight, or
        in a mountain gorge; only this time it comes over us at the thought
        of our supernatural relations; and similarly of all the various
        sentiments which may be called into play in the lives of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg028"/> religious persons. As concrete states of
        mind, made up of a feeling <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plus</span></em> a specific sort of object,
        religious emotions of course are psychic entities distinguishable
        from other concrete emotions; but there is no ground for assuming a
        simple abstract <span class="tei tei-q">“religious emotion”</span> to
        exist as a distinct elementary mental affection by itself, present in
        every religious experience without exception.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As there thus
        seems to be no one elementary religious emotion, but only a common
        storehouse of emotions upon which religious objects may draw, so
        there might conceivably also prove to be no one specific and
        essential kind of religious object, and no one specific and essential
        kind of religious act.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The field of
        religion being as wide as this, it is manifestly impossible that I
        should pretend to cover it. My lectures must be limited to a fraction
        of the subject. And, although it would indeed be foolish to set up an
        abstract definition of religion's essence, and then proceed to defend
        that definition against all comers, yet this need not prevent me from
        taking my own narrow view of what religion shall consist in
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for the
        purpose of these lectures</span></em>, or, out of the many meanings
        of the word, from choosing the one meaning in which I wish to
        interest you particularly, and proclaiming arbitrarily that when I
        say <span class="tei tei-q">“religion”</span> I mean <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>.
        This, in fact, is what I must do, and I will now preliminarily seek
        to mark out the field I choose.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One way to mark it
        out easily is to say what aspects of the subject we leave out. At the
        outset we are struck by one great partition which divides the
        religious field. On the one side of it lies institutional, on the
        other personal religion. As M. P. Sabatier says, one branch of
        religion keeps the divinity, another keeps man most in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg029"/> view. Worship and sacrifice, procedures
        for working on the dispositions of the deity, theology and ceremony
        and ecclesiastical organization, are the essentials of religion in
        the institutional branch. Were we to limit our view to it, we should
        have to define religion as an external art, the art of winning the
        favor of the gods. In the more personal branch of religion it is on
        the contrary the inner dispositions of man himself which form the
        centre of interest, his conscience, his deserts, his helplessness,
        his incompleteness. And although the favor of the God, as forfeited
        or gained, is still an essential feature of the story, and theology
        plays a vital part therein, yet the acts to which this sort of
        religion prompts are personal not ritual acts, the individual
        transacts the business by himself alone, and the ecclesiastical
        organization, with its priests and sacraments and other go-betweens,
        sinks to an altogether secondary place. The relation goes direct from
        heart to heart, from soul to soul, between man and his maker.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now in these
        lectures I propose to ignore the institutional branch entirely, to
        say nothing of the ecclesiastical organization, to consider as little
        as possible the systematic theology and the ideas about the gods
        themselves, and to confine myself as far as I can to personal
        religion pure and simple. To some of you personal religion, thus
        nakedly considered, will no doubt seem too incomplete a thing to wear
        the general name. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is a part of
        religion,”</span> you will say, <span class="tei tei-q">“but only its
        unorganized rudiment; if we are to name it by itself, we had better
        call it man's conscience or morality than his religion. The name
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘religion’</span> should be reserved for the
        fully organized system of feeling, thought, and institution, for the
        Church, in short, of which this personal religion, so called, is but
        a fractional element.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg030"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if you say
        this, it will only show the more plainly how much the question of
        definition tends to become a dispute about names. Rather than prolong
        such a dispute, I am willing to accept almost any name for the
        personal religion of which I propose to treat. Call it conscience or
        morality, if you yourselves prefer, and not religion—under either
        name it will be equally worthy of our study. As for myself, I think
        it will prove to contain some elements which morality pure and simple
        does not contain, and these elements I shall soon seek to point out;
        so I will myself continue to apply the word <span class="tei tei-q">“religion”</span> to it; and in the last lecture of all,
        I will bring in the theologies and the ecclesiasticisms, and say
        something of its relation to them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In one sense at
        least the personal religion will prove itself more fundamental than
        either theology or ecclesiasticism. Churches, when once established,
        live at second-hand upon tradition; but the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">founders</span></em>
        of every church owed their power originally to the fact of their
        direct personal communion with the divine. Not only the superhuman
        founders, the Christ, the Buddha, Mahomet, but all the originators of
        Christian sects have been in this case;—so personal religion should
        still seem the primordial thing, even to those who continue to esteem
        it incomplete.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are, it is
        true, other things in religion chronologically more primordial than
        personal devoutness in the moral sense. Fetishism and magic seem to
        have preceded inward piety historically—at least our records of
        inward piety do not reach back so far. And if fetishism and magic be
        regarded as stages of religion, one may say that personal religion in
        the inward sense and the genuinely spiritual ecclesiasticisms which
        it founds are phenomena of secondary or even tertiary order. But,
        quite <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg031"/> apart from the fact
        that many anthropologists—for instance, Jevons and Frazer—expressly
        oppose <span class="tei tei-q">“religion”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“magic”</span> to each other, it is certain that the
        whole system of thought which leads to magic, fetishism, and the
        lower superstitions may just as well be called primitive science as
        called primitive religion. The question thus becomes a verbal one
        again; and our knowledge of all these early stages of thought and
        feeling is in any case so conjectural and imperfect that farther
        discussion would not be worth while.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Religion,
        therefore, as I now ask you arbitrarily to take it, shall mean for us
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude,
        so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever
        they may consider the divine</span></em>. Since the relation may be
        either moral, physical, or ritual, it is evident that out of religion
        in the sense in which we take it, theologies, philosophies, and
        ecclesiastical organizations may secondarily grow. In these lectures,
        however, as I have already said, the immediate personal experiences
        will amply fill our time, and we shall hardly consider theology or
        ecclesiasticism at all.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We escape much
        controversial matter by this arbitrary definition of our field. But,
        still, a chance of controversy comes up over the word <span class="tei tei-q">“divine”</span> if we take it in the definition in too
        narrow a sense. There are systems of thought which the world usually
        calls religious, and yet which do not positively assume a God.
        Buddhism is in this case. Popularly, of course, the Buddha himself
        stands in place of a God; but in strictness the Buddhistic system is
        atheistic. Modern transcendental idealism, Emersonianism, for
        instance, also seems to let God evaporate into abstract Ideality. Not
        a deity <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">in concreto</span></span>, not a superhuman
        person, but the immanent divinity in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg032"/> things, the essentially spiritual structure of
        the universe, is the object of the transcendentalist cult. In that
        address to the graduating class at Divinity College in 1838 which
        made Emerson famous, the frank expression of this worship of mere
        abstract laws was what made the scandal of the performance.</p>

        themselves. They are out of time, out of space, and not subject to
        circumstance: Thus, in the soul of man there is a justice whose
        retributions are instant and entire. He who does a good deed is
        instantly ennobled. He who does a mean deed is by the action itself
        contracted. He who puts off impurity thereby puts on purity. If a man
        is at heart just, then in so far is he God; the safety of God, the
        immortality of God, the majesty of God, do enter into that man with
        justice. If a man dissemble, deceive, he deceives himself, and goes
        out of acquaintance with his own being. Character is always known.
        Thefts never enrich; alms never impoverish; murder will speak out of
        stone walls. The least admixture of a lie—for example, the taint of
        vanity, any attempt to make a good impression, a favorable
        appearance—will instantly vitiate the effect. But speak the truth,
        and all things alive or brute are vouchers, and the very roots of the
        grass underground there do seem to stir and move to bear your
        witness. For all things proceed out of the same spirit, which is
        differently named love, justice, temperance, in its different
        applications, just as the ocean receives different names on the
        several shores which it washes. In so far as he roves from these
        ends, a man bereaves himself of power, of auxiliaries. His being
        shrinks ... he becomes less and less, a mote, a point, until absolute
        badness is absolute death. The perception of this law awakens in the
        mind a sentiment which we call the religious sentiment, and which
        makes our highest happiness. Wonderful is its power to charm and to
        command. It is a mountain air. It is the embalmer of the world. It
        makes the sky and the hills sublime, and the silent song of the stars
        is it. It is the beatitude of man. It makes him illimitable. When he
        says</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I
        ought</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">; when

          high, the good and great deed; then, deep melodies wander through
          his soul from supreme wisdom. Then he can worship, and be enlarged
          by his worship; for he can never go behind this sentiment. All the
          expressions of this sentiment are sacred and permanent in
          proportion to their purity. [They] affect us more than all other
          compositions. The sentences of the olden time, which ejaculate this
          piety, are still fresh and fragrant. And the unique impression of
          Jesus upon mankind, whose name is not so much written as ploughed
          into the history of this world, is proof of the subtle virtue of
          this infusion.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_10" id="noteref_10" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such is the
        Emersonian religion. The universe has a divine soul of order, which
        soul is moral, being also the soul within the soul of man. But
        whether this soul of the universe be a mere quality like the eye's
        brilliancy or the skin's softness, or whether it be a self-conscious
        life like the eye's seeing or the skin's feeling, is a decision that
        never unmistakably appears in Emerson's pages. It quivers on the
        boundary of these things, sometimes leaning one way, sometimes the
        other, to suit the literary rather than the philosophic need.
        Whatever it is, though, it is active. As much as if it were a God, we
        can trust it to protect all ideal interests and keep the world's
        balance straight. The sentences in which Emerson, to the very end,
        gave utterance to this faith are as fine as anything in literature:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“If you love and serve men, you cannot by any
        hiding or stratagem escape the remuneration. Secret retributions are
        always restoring the level, when disturbed, of the divine justice. It
        is impossible to tilt the beam. All the tyrants and proprietors and
        monopolists of the world in vain set their shoulders to heave the
        bar. Settles forevermore the ponderous equator to its line, and man
        and mote, and star and sun, must range to it, or be pulverized by the
        recoil.”</span><a href="#note_11" id="noteref_11" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg034"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now it would be
        too absurd to say that the inner experiences that underlie such
        expressions of faith as this and impel the writer to their utterance
        are quite unworthy to be called religious experiences. The sort of
        appeal that Emersonian optimism, on the one hand, and Buddhistic
        pessimism, on the other, make to the individual and the sort of
        response which he makes to them in his life are in fact
        indistinguishable from, and in many respects identical with, the best
        Christian appeal and response. We must therefore, from the
        experiential point of view, call these godless or quasi-godless
        creeds <span class="tei tei-q">“religions”</span>; and accordingly
        when in our definition of religion we speak of the individual's
        relation to <span class="tei tei-q">“what he considers the
        divine,”</span> we must interpret the term <span class="tei tei-q">“divine”</span> very broadly, as denoting any object that
        is god<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">like</span></em>, whether it be a concrete deity
        or not.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the term
        <span class="tei tei-q">“godlike,”</span> if thus treated as a
        floating general quality, becomes exceedingly vague, for many gods
        have flourished in religious history, and their attributes have been
        discrepant enough. What then is that essentially godlike quality—be
        it embodied in a concrete deity or not—our relation to which
        determines our character as religious men? It will repay us to seek
        some answer to this question before we proceed farther.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For one thing,
        gods are conceived to be first things in the way of being and power.
        They overarch and envelop, and from them there is no escape. What
        relates to them is the first and last word in the way of truth.
        Whatever then were most primal and enveloping and deeply true might
        at this rate be treated as godlike, and a man's religion might thus
        be identified with his attitude, whatever it might be, towards what
        he felt to be the primal truth.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg035"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such a definition
        as this would in a way be defensible. Religion, whatever it is, is a
        man's total reaction upon life, so why not say that any total
        reaction upon life is a religion? Total reactions are different from
        casual reactions, and total attitudes are different from usual or
        professional attitudes. To get at them you must go behind the
        foreground of existence and reach down to that curious sense of the
        whole residual cosmos as an everlasting presence, intimate or alien,
        terrible or amusing, lovable or odious, which in some degree every
        one possesses. This sense of the world's presence, appealing as it
        does to our peculiar individual temperament, makes us either
        strenuous or careless, devout or blasphemous, gloomy or exultant,
        about life at large; and our reaction, involuntary and inarticulate
        and often half unconscious as it is, is the completest of all our
        answers to the question, <span class="tei tei-q">“What is the
        character of this universe in which we dwell?”</span> It expresses
        our individual sense of it in the most definite way. Why then not
        call these reactions our religion, no matter what specific character
        they may have? Non-religious as some of these reactions may be, in
        one sense of the word <span class="tei tei-q">“religious,”</span>
        they yet belong to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the general sphere of the religious
        life</span></em>, and so should generically be classed as religious
        reactions. <span class="tei tei-q">“He believes in No-God, and he
        worships him,”</span> said a colleague of mine of a student who was
        manifesting a fine atheistic ardor; and the more fervent opponents of
        Christian doctrine have often enough shown a temper which,
        psychologically considered, is indistinguishable from religious
        zeal.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But so very broad
        a use of the word <span class="tei tei-q">“religion”</span> would be
        inconvenient, however defensible it might remain on logical grounds.
        There are trifling, sneering attitudes even towards the whole of
        life; and in some men these <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg
        036]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg036"/>
        attitudes are final and systematic. It would strain the ordinary use
        of language too much to call such attitudes religious, even though,
        from the point of view of an unbiased critical philosophy, they might
        conceivably be perfectly reasonable ways of looking upon life.
        Voltaire, for example, writes thus to a friend, at the age of
        seventy-three: <span class="tei tei-q">“As for myself,”</span> he
        says, <span class="tei tei-q">“weak as I am, I carry on the war to
        the last moment, I get a hundred pike-thrusts, I return two hundred,
        and I laugh. I see near my door Geneva on fire with quarrels over
        nothing, and I laugh again; and, thank God, I can look upon the world
        as a farce even when it becomes as tragic as it sometimes does. All
        comes out even at the end of the day, and all comes out still more
        even when all the days are over.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Much as we may
        admire such a robust old gamecock spirit in a valetudinarian, to call
        it a religious spirit would be odd. Yet it is for the moment
        Voltaire's reaction on the whole of life. <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Je
        m'en fiche</span></span> is the vulgar French equivalent for our
        English ejaculation <span class="tei tei-q">“Who cares?”</span> And
        the happy term <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">je m'en fichisme</span></span>
        recently has been invented to designate the systematic determination
        not to take anything in life too solemnly. <span class="tei tei-q">“All is vanity”</span> is the relieving word in all
        difficult crises for this mode of thought, which that exquisite
        literary genius Renan took pleasure, in his later days of sweet
        decay, in putting into coquettishly sacrilegious forms which remain
        to us as excellent expressions of the <span class="tei tei-q">“all is
        vanity”</span> state of mind. Take the following passage, for
        example,—we must hold to duty, even against the evidence, Renan
        says,—but he then goes on:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">

          voices, but in such a way that if the second hypothesis were true
          we should not have been too completely duped. If in effect the
          world be not a serious thing, it is the dogmatic people who will be
          the shallow ones, and the worldly minded whom the theologians now
          call frivolous will be those who are really wise.</span></span></p>

          for anything—that perhaps is wisdom. Give ourselves up, according
          to the hour, to confidence, to skepticism, to optimism, to irony,
          and we may be sure that at certain moments at least we shall be
          with the truth.... Good-humor is a philosophic state of mind; it
          seems to say to Nature that we take her no more seriously than she
          takes us. I maintain that one should always talk of philosophy with
          a smile. We owe it to the Eternal to be virtuous; but we have the
          right to add to this tribute our irony as a sort of personal
          reprisal. In this way we return to the right quarter jest for jest;
          we play the trick that has been played on us. Saint Augustine's
          phrase:</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Lord, if we are deceived, it
          is by thee!</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">remains a
          fine one, well suited to our modern feeling. Only we wish the
          Eternal to know that if we accept the fraud, we accept it knowingly
          and willingly. We are resigned in advance to losing the interest on
          our investments of virtue, but we wish not to appear ridiculous by
          having counted on them too securely.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_12" id="noteref_12" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Surely all the
        usual associations of the word <span class="tei tei-q">“religion”</span> would have to be stripped away if such
        a systematic <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">parti pris</span></span> of irony were also to
        be denoted by the name. For common men <span class="tei tei-q">“religion,”</span> whatever more special meanings it may
        have, signifies always a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">serious</span></em> state of mind. If any one
        phrase could gather its universal message, that phrase would be,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“All is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> vanity in this Universe,
        whatever the appearances may suggest.”</span> If it can stop
        anything, religion as commonly apprehended can stop just such
        chaffing talk as Renan's. It favors gravity, not pertness; it says
        <span class="tei tei-q">“hush”</span> to all vain chatter and smart
        wit.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg038"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if hostile to
        light irony, religion is equally hostile to heavy grumbling and
        complaint. The world appears tragic enough in some religions, but the
        tragedy is realized as purging, and a way of deliverance is held to
        exist. We shall see enough of the religious melancholy in a future
        lecture; but melancholy, according to our ordinary use of language,
        forfeits all title to be called religious when, in Marcus Aurelius's
        racy words, the sufferer simply lies kicking and screaming after the
        fashion of a sacrificed pig. The mood of a Schopenhauer or a
        Nietzsche,—and in a less degree one may sometimes say the same of our
        own sad Carlyle,—though often an ennobling sadness, is almost as
        often only peevishness running away with the bit between its teeth.
        The sallies of the two German authors remind one, half the time, of
        the sick shriekings of two dying rats. They lack the purgatorial note
        which religious sadness gives forth.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There must be
        something solemn, serious, and tender about any attitude which we
        denominate religious. If glad, it must not grin or snicker; if sad,
        it must not scream or curse. It is precisely as being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">solemn</span></em>
        experiences that I wish to interest you in religious experiences. So
        I propose—arbitrarily again, if you please—to narrow our definition
        once more by saying that the word <span class="tei tei-q">“divine,”</span> as employed therein, shall mean for us
        not merely the primal and enveloping and real, for that meaning if
        taken without restriction might well prove too broad. The divine
        shall mean for us only such a primal reality as the individual feels
        impelled to respond to solemnly and gravely, and neither by a curse
        nor a jest.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But solemnity, and
        gravity, and all such emotional attributes, admit of various shades;
        and, do what we will with our defining, the truth must at last be
        confronted <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg
        039]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg039"/>
        that we are dealing with a field of experience where there is not a
        single conception that can be sharply drawn. The pretension, under
        such conditions, to be rigorously <span class="tei tei-q">“scientific”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“exact”</span> in our terms would only stamp us as
        lacking in understanding of our task. Things are more or less divine,
        states of mind are more or less religious, reactions are more or less
        total, but the boundaries are always misty, and it is everywhere a
        question of amount and degree. Nevertheless, at their extreme of
        development, there can never be any question as to what experiences
        are religious. The divinity of the object and the solemnity of the
        reaction are too well marked for doubt. Hesitation as to whether a
        state of mind is <span class="tei tei-q">“religious,”</span> or
        <span class="tei tei-q">“irreligious,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“moral,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“philosophical,”</span> is only likely to arise when the
        state of mind is weakly characterized, but in that case it will be
        hardly worthy of our study at all. With states that can only by
        courtesy be called religious we need have nothing to do, our only
        profitable business being with what nobody can possibly feel tempted
        to call anything else. I said in my former lecture that we learn most
        about a thing when we view it under a microscope, as it were, or in
        its most exaggerated form. This is as true of religious phenomena as
        of any other kind of fact. The only cases likely to be profitable
        enough to repay our attention will therefore be cases where the
        religious spirit is unmistakable and extreme. Its fainter
        manifestations we may tranquilly pass by. Here, for example, is the
        total reaction upon life of Frederick Locker Lampson, whose
        autobiography, entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“Confidences,”</span>
        proves him to have been a most amiable man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is a complex,
        a tender, a submissive, and a graceful state of mind. For myself, I
        should have no objection to calling it on the whole a religious state
        of mind, although I dare say that to many of you it may seem too
        listless and half-hearted to merit so good a name. But what matters
        it in the end whether we call such a state of mind religious or not?
        It is too insignificant for our instruction in any case; and its very
        possessor wrote it down in terms which he would not have used unless
        he had been thinking of more energetically religious moods in others,
        with which he found himself unable to compete. It is with these more
        energetic states that our sole business lies, and we can perfectly
        well afford to let the minor notes and the uncertain border go.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the
        extremer cases that I had in mind a little while ago when I said that
        personal religion, even without theology or ritual, would prove to
        embody some elements that morality pure and simple does not contain.
        You may remember that I promised shortly to point out <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg041"/> what those elements were. In a general
        way I can now say what I had in mind.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I accept the universe”</span> is reported to have been a
        favorite utterance of our New England transcendentalist, Margaret
        Fuller; and when some one repeated this phrase to Thomas Carlyle, his
        sardonic comment is said to have been: <span class="tei tei-q">“Gad!
        she'd better!”</span> At bottom the whole concern of both morality
        and religion is with the manner of our acceptance of the universe. Do
        we accept it only in part and grudgingly, or heartily and altogether?
        Shall our protests against certain things in it be radical and
        unforgiving, or shall we think that, even with evil, there are ways
        of living that must lead to good? If we accept the whole, shall we do
        so as if stunned into submission,—as Carlyle would have
        us—<span class="tei tei-q">“Gad! we'd better!”</span>—or shall we do
        so with enthusiastic assent? Morality pure and simple accepts the law
        of the whole which it finds reigning, so far as to acknowledge and
        obey it, but it may obey it with the heaviest and coldest heart, and
        never cease to feel it as a yoke. But for religion, in its strong and
        fully developed manifestations, the service of the highest never is
        felt as a yoke. Dull submission is left far behind, and a mood of
        welcome, which may fill any place on the scale between cheerful
        serenity and enthusiastic gladness, has taken its place.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It makes a
        tremendous emotional and practical difference to one whether one
        accept the universe in the drab discolored way of stoic resignation
        to necessity, or with the passionate happiness of Christian saints.
        The difference is as great as that between passivity and activity, as
        that between the defensive and the aggressive mood. Gradual as are
        the steps by which an individual may <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg042"/> grow from one state into the other, many as are
        the intermediate stages which different individuals represent, yet
        when you place the typical extremes beside each other for comparison,
        you feel that two discontinuous psychological universes confront you,
        and that in passing from one to the other a <span class="tei tei-q">“critical point”</span> has been overcome.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we compare
        stoic with Christian ejaculations we see much more than a difference
        of doctrine; rather is it a difference of emotional mood that parts
        them. When Marcus Aurelius reflects on the eternal reason that has
        ordered things, there is a frosty chill about his words which you
        rarely find in a Jewish, and never in a Christian piece of religious
        writing. The universe is <span class="tei tei-q">“accepted”</span> by
        all these writers; but how devoid of passion or exultation the spirit
        of the Roman Emperor is! Compare his fine sentence: <span class="tei tei-q">“If gods care not for me or my children, here is a reason
        for it,”</span> with Job's cry: <span class="tei tei-q">“Though he
        slay me, yet will I trust in him!”</span> and you immediately see the
        difference I mean. The <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">anima
        mundi</span></span>, to whose disposal of his own personal destiny
        the Stoic consents, is there to be respected and submitted to, but
        the Christian God is there to be loved; and the difference of
        emotional atmosphere is like that between an arctic climate and the
        tropics, though the outcome in the way of accepting actual conditions
        uncomplainingly may seem in abstract terms to be much the same.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Compare now this

        renounce all desire and choice, and commit and commend themselves and
        all things to the eternal Goodness, so that every enlightened man
        could say:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I would fain be
        to the Eternal Goodness what his own hand is to a
        man.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">Such men are in a state of freedom,
          because they have lost the fear of pain or hell, and the hope of
          reward or heaven, and are living in pure submission to the eternal
          Goodness, in the perfect freedom of fervent love. When a man truly
          perceiveth and considereth himself, who and what he is, and findeth
          himself utterly vile and wicked and unworthy, he falleth into such
          a deep abasement that it seemeth to him reasonable that all
          creatures in heaven and earth should rise up against him. And
          therefore he will not and dare not desire any consolation and
          release; but he is willing to be unconsoled and unreleased; and he
          doth not grieve over his sufferings, for they are right in his
          eyes, and he hath nothing to say against them. This is what is
          meant by true repentance for sin; and he who in this present time
          entereth into this hell, none may console him. Now God hath not
          forsaken a man in this hell, but He is laying his hand upon him,
          that the man may not desire nor regard anything but the eternal
          Good only. And then, when the man neither careth for nor desireth
          anything but the eternal Good alone, and seeketh</span>

          rest, and consolation, and so the man is henceforth in the kingdom
          of heaven. This hell and this heaven are two good safe ways for a

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How much more

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a good rule
        in physiology, when we are studying the meaning of an organ, to ask
        after its most peculiar and characteristic sort of performance, and
        to seek its office in that one of its functions which no other organ
        can possibly exert. Surely the same maxim holds good in our present
        quest. The essence of religious experiences, the thing by which we
        finally must judge them, must be that element or quality in them
        which we can meet nowhere else. And such a quality will be of course
        most prominent and easy to notice in those religious experiences
        which are most one-sided, exaggerated, and intense.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now when we
        compare these intenser experiences with the experiences of tamer
        minds, so cool and reasonable that we are tempted to call them
        philosophical rather than religious, we find a character that is
        perfectly distinct. That character, it seems to me, should be
        regarded as the practically important <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">differentia</span></span> of religion for our
        purpose; and just what it is can easily be brought out by comparing
        the mind of an abstractly conceived Christian with that of a moralist
        similarly conceived.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A life is manly,
        stoical, moral, or philosophical, we say, in proportion as it is less
        swayed by paltry personal considerations and more by objective ends
        that call for energy, even though that energy bring personal loss and
        pain. This is the good side of war, in so far as it calls for
        <span class="tei tei-q">“volunteers.”</span> And for morality life is
        a war, and the service of the highest is a sort of cosmic patriotism
        which also calls for volunteers. Even a sick man, unable to be
        militant outwardly, can carry on the moral warfare. He can willfully
        turn his attention away from his own <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg046"/> future, whether in this world or the next. He
        can train himself to indifference to his present drawbacks and
        immerse himself in whatever objective interests still remain
        accessible. He can follow public news, and sympathize with other
        people's affairs. He can cultivate cheerful manners, and be silent
        about his miseries. He can contemplate whatever ideal aspects of
        existence his philosophy is able to present to him, and practice
        whatever duties, such as patience, resignation, trust, his ethical
        system requires. Such a man lives on his loftiest, largest plane. He
        is a high-hearted freeman and no pining slave. And yet he lacks
        something which the Christian <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">par
        excellence</span></span>, the mystic and ascetic saint, for example,
        has in abundant measure, and which makes of him a human being of an
        altogether different denomination.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Christian also
        spurns the pinched and mumping sick-room attitude, and the lives of
        saints are full of a kind of callousness to diseased conditions of
        body which probably no other human records show. But whereas the
        merely moralistic spurning takes an effort of volition, the Christian
        spurning is the result of the excitement of a higher kind of emotion,
        in the presence of which no exertion of volition is required. The
        moralist must hold his breath and keep his muscles tense; and so long
        as this athletic attitude is possible all goes well—morality
        suffices. But the athletic attitude tends ever to break down, and it
        inevitably does break down even in the most stalwart when the
        organism begins to decay, or when morbid fears invade the mind. To
        suggest personal will and effort to one all sicklied o'er with the
        sense of irremediable impotence is to suggest the most impossible of
        things. What he craves is to be consoled in his very powerlessness,
        to feel that the spirit of the universe recognizes and secures him,
        all decaying and failing as he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg047"/> is. Well, we are all such helpless failures in
        the last resort. The sanest and best of us are of one clay with
        lunatics and prison inmates, and death finally runs the robustest of
        us down. And whenever we feel this, such a sense of the vanity and
        provisionality of our voluntary career comes over us that all our
        morality appears but as a plaster hiding a sore it can never cure,
        and all our well-doing as the hollowest substitute for that
        well-<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being</span></em> that our lives ought to be
        grounded in, but, alas! are not.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And here religion
        comes to our rescue and takes our fate into her hands. There is a
        state of mind, known to religious men, but to no others, in which the
        will to assert ourselves and hold our own has been displaced by a
        willingness to close our mouths and be as nothing in the floods and
        waterspouts of God. In this state of mind, what we most dreaded has
        become the habitation of our safety, and the hour of our moral death
        has turned into our spiritual birthday. The time for tension in our
        soul is over, and that of happy relaxation, of calm deep breathing,
        of an eternal present, with no discordant future to be anxious about,
        has arrived. Fear is not held in abeyance as it is by mere morality,
        it is positively expunged and washed away.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We shall see
        abundant examples of this happy state of mind in later lectures of
        this course. We shall see how infinitely passionate a thing religion
        at its highest flights can be. Like love, like wrath, like hope,
        ambition, jealousy, like every other instinctive eagerness and
        impulse, it adds to life an enchantment which is not rationally or
        logically deducible from anything else. This enchantment, coming as a
        gift when it does come,—a gift of our organism, the physiologists
        will tell us, a gift of God's grace, the theologians say,—is either
        there or not there for us, and there are persons who can no more
        become <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg048"/> possessed by it than
        they can fall in love with a given woman by mere word of command.
        Religious feeling is thus an absolute addition to the Subject's range
        of life. It gives him a new sphere of power. When the outward battle
        is lost, and the outer world disowns him, it redeems and vivifies an
        interior world which otherwise would be an empty waste.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If religion is to
        mean anything definite for us, it seems to me that we ought to take
        it as meaning this added dimension of emotion, this enthusiastic
        temper of espousal, in regions where morality strictly so called can
        at best but bow its head and acquiesce. It ought to mean nothing
        short of this new reach of freedom for us, with the struggle over,
        the keynote of the universe sounding in our ears, and everlasting
        possession spread before our eyes.<a href="#note_19" id="noteref_19" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This sort of
        happiness in the absolute and everlasting is what we find nowhere but
        in religion. It is parted off from all mere animal happiness, all
        mere enjoyment of the present, by that element of solemnity of which
        I have already made so much account. Solemnity is a hard thing to
        define abstractly, but certain of its marks are patent enough. A
        solemn state of mind is never crude or simple—it seems to contain a
        certain measure of its own opposite in solution. A solemn joy
        preserves a sort of bitter in its sweetness; a solemn sorrow is one
        to which we intimately consent. But there are writers who, realizing
        that happiness of a supreme sort is the prerogative of religion,
        forget this complication, and call all happiness, as such, religious.
        Mr. Havelock Ellis, for example, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg049"/> identifies religion with the entire field of
        the soul's liberation from oppressive moods.</p>

          as an instrument of religion. Indeed, in all countries and in all
          ages, some form of physical enlargement—singing, dancing, drinking,
          sexual excitement—has been intimately associated with worship. Even
          the momentary expansion of the soul in laughter is, to however
          slight an extent, a religious exercise.... Whenever an impulse from
          the world strikes against the organism, and the resultant is not
          discomfort or pain, not even the muscular contraction of strenuous
          manhood, but a joyous expansion or aspiration of the whole
          soul—there is religion. It is the infinite for which we hunger, and
          we ride gladly on every little wave that promises to bear us
          towards it.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_20" id="noteref_20" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But such a
        straight identification of religion with any and every form of
        happiness leaves the essential peculiarity of religious happiness
        out. The more commonplace happinesses which we get are <span class="tei tei-q">“reliefs,”</span> occasioned by our momentary escapes
        from evils either experienced or threatened. But in its most
        characteristic embodiments, religious happiness is no mere feeling of
        escape. It cares no longer to escape. It consents to the evil
        outwardly as a form of sacrifice—inwardly it knows it to be
        permanently overcome. If you ask <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how</span></em>
        religion thus falls on the thorns and faces death, and in the very
        act annuls annihilation, I cannot explain the matter, for it is
        religion's secret, and to understand it you must yourself have been a
        religious man of the extremer type. In our future examples, even of
        the simplest and healthiest-minded type of religious consciousness,
        we shall find this complex sacrificial constitution, in which a
        higher happiness holds a lower unhappiness in check. In the Louvre
        there is a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg
        050]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg050"/>
        picture, by Guido Reni, of St. Michael with his foot on Satan's neck.
        The richness of the picture is in large part due to the fiend's
        figure being there. The richness of its allegorical meaning also is
        due to his being there—that is, the world is all the richer for
        having a devil in it, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">so long as we keep our foot upon his
        neck</span></em>. In the religious consciousness, that is just the
        position in which the fiend, the negative or tragic principle, is
        found; and for that very reason the religious consciousness is so
        rich from the emotional point of view.<a href="#note_21" id="noteref_21" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> We shall
        see how in certain men and women it takes on a monstrously ascetic
        form. There are saints who have literally fed on the negative
        principle, on humiliation and privation, and the thought of suffering
        and death,—their souls growing in happiness just in proportion as
        their outward state grew more intolerable. No other emotion than
        religious emotion can bring a man to this peculiar pass. And it is
        for that reason that when we ask our question about the value of
        religion for human life, I think we ought to look for the answer
        among these violenter examples rather than among those of a more
        moderate hue.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having the
        phenomenon of our study in its acutest possible form to start with,
        we can shade down as much as we please later. And if in these cases,
        repulsive as they are to our ordinary worldly way of judging, we find
        ourselves compelled to acknowledge religion's value and treat it with
        respect, it will have proved in some way its value for life at large.
        By subtracting and toning down extravagances we may thereupon proceed
        to trace the boundaries of its legitimate sway.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To be sure, it
        makes our task difficult to have to deal so much with eccentricities
        and extremes. <span class="tei tei-q">“How <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg051"/> religion on the whole be the
        most important of all human functions,”</span> you may ask,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“if every several manifestation of it in turn
        have to be corrected and sobered down and pruned away?”</span> Such a
        thesis seems a paradox impossible to sustain reasonably,—yet I
        believe that something like it will have to be our final contention.
        That personal attitude which the individual finds himself impelled to
        take up towards what he apprehends to be the divine—and you will
        remember that this was our definition—will prove to be both a
        helpless and a sacrificial attitude. That is, we shall have to
        confess to at least some amount of dependence on sheer mercy, and to
        practice some amount of renunciation, great or small, to save our
        souls alive. The constitution of the world we live in requires
        it:—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For when all is
        said and done, we are in the end absolutely dependent on the
        universe; and into sacrifices and surrenders of some sort,
        deliberately looked at and accepted, we are drawn and pressed as into
        our only permanent positions of repose. Now in those states of mind
        which fall short of religion, the surrender is submitted to as an
        imposition of necessity, and the sacrifice is undergone at the very
        best without complaint. In the religious life, on the contrary,
        surrender and sacrifice are positively espoused: even unnecessary
        givings-up are added in order that the happiness may increase.
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Religion
        thus makes easy and felicitous what in any case is

        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg052"/> stands vindicated beyond
        dispute. It becomes an essential organ of our life, performing a
        function which no other portion of our nature can so successfully
        fulfill. From the merely biological point of view, so to call it,
        this is a conclusion to which, so far as I can now see, we shall
        inevitably be led, and led moreover by following the purely empirical
        method of demonstration which I sketched to you in the first lecture.
        Of the farther office of religion as a metaphysical revelation I will
        say nothing now.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But to foreshadow
        the terminus of one's investigations is one thing, and to arrive
        there safely is another. In the next lecture, abandoning the extreme
        generalities which have engrossed us hitherto, I propose that we
        begin our actual journey by addressing ourselves directly to the
        concrete facts.</p>

<span style="font-size: 173%">Lecture III. The Reality Of The
        Unseen.</span></h1>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Were one asked to
        characterize the life of religion in the broadest and most general
        terms possible, one might say that it consists of the belief that
        there is an unseen order, and that our supreme good lies in
        harmoniously adjusting ourselves thereto. This belief and this
        adjustment are the religious attitude in the soul. I wish during this
        hour to call your attention to some of the psychological
        peculiarities of such an attitude as this, of belief in an object
        which we cannot see. All our attitudes, moral, practical, or
        emotional, as well as religious, are due to the <span class="tei tei-q">“objects”</span> of our consciousness, the things which
        we believe to exist, whether really or ideally, along with ourselves.
        Such objects may be present to our senses, or they may be present
        only to our thought. In either case they elicit from us a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reaction</span></em>;
        and the reaction due to things of thought is notoriously in many
        cases as strong as that due to sensible presences. It may be even
        stronger. The memory of an insult may make us angrier than the insult
        did when we received it. We are frequently more ashamed of our
        blunders afterwards than we were at the moment of making them; and in
        general our whole higher prudential and moral life is based on the
        fact that material sensations actually present may have a weaker
        influence on our action than ideas of remoter facts.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The more concrete
        objects of most men's religion, the deities whom they worship, are
        known to them only in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg
        054]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg054"/>
        idea. It has been vouchsafed, for example, to very few Christian
        believers to have had a sensible vision of their Saviour; though
        enough appearances of this sort are on record, by way of miraculous
        exception, to merit our attention later. The whole force of the
        Christian religion, therefore, so far as belief in the divine
        personages determines the prevalent attitude of the believer, is in
        general exerted by the instrumentality of pure ideas, of which
        nothing in the individual's past experience directly serves as a
        model.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in addition to
        these ideas of the more concrete religious objects, religion is full
        of abstract objects which prove to have an equal power. God's
        attributes as such, his holiness, his justice, his mercy, his
        absoluteness, his infinity, his omniscience, his tri-unity, the
        various mysteries of the redemptive process, the operation of the
        sacraments, etc., have proved fertile wells of inspiring meditation
        for Christian believers.<a href="#note_22" id="noteref_22" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a> We shall
        see later that the absence of definite sensible images is positively
        insisted on by the mystical authorities in all religions as the
        <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sine qua non</span></span> of a successful
        orison, or contemplation of the higher divine truths. Such
        contemplations are expected (and abundantly verify the expectation,
        as we shall also see) to influence the believer's subsequent attitude
        very powerfully for good.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Immanuel Kant held
        a curious doctrine about such objects of belief as God, the design of
        creation, the soul, its freedom, and the life hereafter. These
        things, he said, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg
        055]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg055"/> are
        properly not objects of knowledge at all. Our conceptions always
        require a sense-content to work with, and as the words <span class="tei tei-q">“soul,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“God,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“immortality,”</span> cover no distinctive
        sense-content whatever, it follows that theoretically speaking they
        are words devoid of any significance. Yet strangely enough they have
        a definite meaning <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for our practice</span></em>. We can act
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as
        if</span></em> there were a God; feel <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as if</span></em> we
        were free; consider Nature <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as if</span></em> she were full of special
        designs; lay plans <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as if</span></em> we were to be immortal; and we
        find then that these words do make a genuine difference in our moral
        life. Our faith <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> these unintelligible objects
        actually exist proves thus to be a full equivalent in <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">praktischer Hinsicht</span></span>, as Kant
        calls it, or from the point of view of our action, for a knowledge of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what</span></em> they might be, in case we were
        permitted positively to conceive them. So we have the strange
        phenomenon, as Kant assures us, of a mind believing with all its
        strength in the real presence of a set of things of no one of which
        it can form any notion whatsoever.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My object in thus
        recalling Kant's doctrine to your mind is not to express any opinion
        as to the accuracy of this particularly uncouth part of his
        philosophy, but only to illustrate the characteristic of human nature
        which we are considering, by an example so classical in its
        exaggeration. The sentiment of reality can indeed attach itself so
        strongly to our object of belief that our whole life is polarized
        through and through, so to speak, by its sense of the existence of
        the thing believed in, and yet that thing, for purpose of definite
        description, can hardly be said to be present to our mind at all. It
        is as if a bar of iron, without touch or sight, with no
        representative faculty whatever, might nevertheless be strongly
        endowed with an inner capacity for magnetic feeling; and as if,
        through the various arousals of its magnetism by magnets coming
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg056"/> and going in its neighborhood,
        it might be consciously determined to different attitudes and
        tendencies. Such a bar of iron could never give you an outward
        description of the agencies that had the power of stirring it so
        strongly; yet of their presence, and of their significance for its
        life, it would be intensely aware through every fibre of its
        being.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not only the
        Ideas of pure Reason, as Kant styled them, that have this power of
        making us vitally feel presences that we are impotent articulately to
        describe. All sorts of higher abstractions bring with them the same
        kind of impalpable appeal. Remember those passages from Emerson which
        I read at my last lecture. The whole universe of concrete objects, as
        we know them, swims, not only for such a transcendentalist writer,
        but for all of us, in a wider and higher universe of abstract ideas,
        that lend it its significance. As time, space, and the ether soak
        through all things, so (we feel) do abstract and essential goodness,
        beauty, strength, significance, justice, soak through all things
        good, strong, significant, and just.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such ideas, and
        others equally abstract, form the background for all our facts, the
        fountain-head of all the possibilities we conceive of. They give its
        <span class="tei tei-q">“nature,”</span> as we call it, to every
        special thing. Everything we know is <span class="tei tei-q">“what”</span> it is by sharing in the nature of one of
        these abstractions. We can never look directly at them, for they are
        bodiless and featureless and footless, but we grasp all other things
        by their means, and in handling the real world we should be stricken
        with helplessness in just so far forth as we might lose these mental
        objects, these adjectives and adverbs and predicates and heads of
        classification and conception.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This absolute
        determinability of our mind by abstractions <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg057"/> is one of the cardinal facts in our human
        constitution. Polarizing and magnetizing us as they do, we turn
        towards them and from them, we seek them, hold them, hate them, bless
        them, just as if they were so many concrete beings. And beings they
        are, beings as real in the realm which they inhabit as the changing
        things of sense are in the realm of space.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Plato gave so
        brilliant and impressive a defense of this common human feeling, that
        the doctrine of the reality of abstract objects has been known as the
        platonic theory of ideas ever since. Abstract Beauty, for example, is
        for Plato a perfectly definite individual being, of which the
        intellect is aware as of something additional to all the perishing
        beauties of the earth. <span class="tei tei-q">“The true order of
        going,”</span> he says, in the often quoted passage in his
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Banquet,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“is
        to use the beauties of earth as steps along which one mounts upwards
        for the sake of that other Beauty, going from one to two, and from
        two to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair actions, and from
        fair actions to fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at
        the notion of absolute Beauty, and at last knows what the essence of
        Beauty is.”</span><a href="#note_23" id="noteref_23" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> In our
        last lecture we had a glimpse of the way in which a platonizing
        writer like Emerson may treat the abstract divineness of things, the
        moral structure of the universe, as a fact worthy of worship. In
        those various churches without a God which to-day are spreading
        through the world under the name of ethical societies, we have a
        similar worship of the abstract divine, the moral law believed in as
        an ultimate object. <span class="tei tei-q">“Science”</span> in many
        minds is genuinely taking the place of a religion. Where this is so,
        the scientist treats the <span class="tei tei-q">“Laws of
        Nature”</span> as objective facts to be revered. A brilliant school
        of interpretation of Greek mythology <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg058"/> would have it that in their origin the Greek
        gods were only half-metaphoric personifications of those great
        spheres of abstract law and order into which the natural world falls
        apart—the sky-sphere, the ocean-sphere, the earth-sphere, and the
        like; just as even now we may speak of the smile of the morning, the
        kiss of the breeze, or the bite of the cold, without really meaning
        that these phenomena of nature actually wear a human face.<a href="#note_24" id="noteref_24" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards the
        origin of the Greek gods, we need not at present seek an opinion. But
        the whole array of our instances leads to a conclusion something like
        this: It is as if there were in the human consciousness a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sense of reality, a
        feeling of objective presence, a perception</span></em> of what we
        may call <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">something
        there</span></em>,”</span> more deep and more general than any of the
        special and particular <span class="tei tei-q">“senses”</span> by
        which the current psychology supposes existent realities to be
        originally revealed. If this were so, we might suppose the senses to
        waken our attitudes and conduct as they so habitually do, by first
        exciting this sense of reality; but anything else, any idea, for
        example, that might similarly excite it, would have that same
        prerogative of appearing real which objects of sense normally
        possess. So far as religious conceptions were able to touch this
        reality-feeling, they would be believed in in spite of criticism,
        even though they might be so vague and remote as to be almost
        unimaginable, even though they might be such non-entities in point of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whatness</span></em>, as Kant makes the objects
        of his moral theology to be.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most curious
        proofs of the existence of such an undifferentiated sense of reality
        as this are found in experiences of hallucination. It often happens
        that an <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg059"/> hallucination is
        imperfectly developed: the person affected will feel a <span class="tei tei-q">“presence”</span> in the room, definitely localized,
        facing in one particular way, real in the most emphatic sense of the
        word, often coming suddenly, and as suddenly gone; and yet neither
        seen, heard, touched, nor cognized in any of the usual <span class="tei tei-q">“sensible”</span> ways. Let me give you an example of
        this, before I pass to the objects with whose presence religion is
        more peculiarly concerned.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An intimate friend

<span style="font-size: 90%">The experiences which I have in mind are

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">It was about September, 1884, when I had the first
          experience. On the previous night I had had, after getting into bed
          at my rooms in College, a vivid tactile hallucination of being
          grasped by the arm, which made me get up and search the room for an
          intruder; but the sense of presence properly so called came on the
          next night. After I had got into bed and blown out the candle, I
          lay awake awhile thinking on the previous night's experience, when
          suddenly I</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">felt</span></em> <span style="font-size: 90%">something come into the room and stay close to my
          bed. It remained only a minute or two. I did not recognize it by
          any ordinary sense, and yet there was a horribly unpleasant</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">sensation</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">connected with it. It stirred something more at
          the roots of my being than any ordinary perception. The feeling had
          something of the quality of a very large tearing vital pain
          spreading chiefly over the chest, but within the organism—and yet
          the feeling</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg

          At all events, something was present with me, and I knew its
          presence far more surely than I have ever known the presence of any
          fleshly living creature. I was conscious of its departure as of its
          coming: an almost instantaneously swift going through the door, and
          the</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">horrible
          sensation</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>

          absorbed in some lectures which I was preparing, and I was still

          (though not of the</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">coming</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">) of the thing that was there the night before,

          could not explain itself, to go, and that I would compel it to go.
          It went as on the previous night, and my body quickly recovered its
          normal state.</span></span></p>

          sensation.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">Once it lasted a full quarter of an
          hour. In all three instances the certainty that there in outward

<span style="font-size: 90%">was indescribably</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">stronger</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">than
          the ordinary certainty of companionship when we are in the close
          presence of ordinary living people. The something seemed close to
          me, and intensely more real than any ordinary perception. Although
          I felt it to be like unto myself, so to speak, or finite, small,
          and distressful, as it were, I didn't recognize it as any
          individual being or person.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of course such an
        experience as this does not connect itself with the religious sphere.
        Yet it may upon occasion do so; and the same correspondent informs me

        developed with equal intensity and abruptness, only then it was
        filled with a quality of joy.</p>

        oddly happens, does not interpret these latter experiences
        theistically, as signifying the presence of God. But it would clearly
        not have been unnatural to interpret them as a revelation of the
        deity's existence. When we reach the subject of mysticism, we shall
        have much more to say upon this head.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lest the oddity of
        these phenomena should disconcert you, I will venture to read you a
        couple of similar narratives, much shorter, merely to show that we
        are dealing with a well-marked natural kind of fact. In the first
        case, which I take from the Journal of the Society for Psychical
        Research, the sense of presence developed in a few moments into a
        distinctly visualized hallucination,—but I leave that part of the

        aware, with an intenseness not easily imagined by those who had never
        experienced it, that another being or presence was not only in the
        room, but quite close to me. I put my book down, and although my
        excitement was great, I felt quite collected, and not conscious of
        any sense of fear. Without changing my position, and looking straight
        at the fire, I knew somehow that my friend A. H. was standing at my
        left elbow, but so far behind me as to be hidden by the armchair in
        which I was leaning back. Moving my eyes round slightly without
        otherwise changing my position, the lower portion of one leg became
        visible, and I instantly recognized the gray-blue material of

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In an earlier book
        of mine I have cited at full length a curious case of presence felt
        by a blind man. The presence was that of the figure of a gray-bearded
        man dressed in a pepper and salt suit, squeezing himself under the
        crack of the door and moving across the floor of the room towards a
        sofa. The blind subject of this quasi-hallucination is an
        exceptionally intelligent reporter. He is entirely without internal
        visual imagery and cannot represent light or colors to himself, and
        is positive that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg
        063]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg063"/> his
        other senses, hearing, etc., were not involved in this false
        perception. It seems to have been an abstract conception rather, with
        the feelings of reality and spatial outwardness directly attached to
        it—in other words, a fully objectified and exteriorized <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such cases, taken
        along with others which would be too tedious for quotation, seem
        sufficiently to prove the existence in our mental machinery of a
        sense of present reality more diffused and general than that which
        our special senses yield. For the psychologists the tracing of the
        organic seat of such a feeling would form a pretty problem—nothing
        could be more natural than to connect it with the muscular sense,
        with the feeling that our muscles were innervating themselves for
        action. Whatsoever thus innervated our activity, or <span class="tei tei-q">“made our flesh creep,”</span>—our senses are what do so
        oftenest,—might then appear real and present, even though it were but
        an abstract idea. But with such vague conjectures we have no concern
        at present, for our interest lies with the faculty rather than with
        its organic seat.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Like all positive
        affections of consciousness, the sense of reality has its negative

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may now lay it
        down as certain that in the distinctively religious sphere of
        experience, many persons (how many we cannot tell) possess the
        objects of their belief, not in the form of mere conceptions which
        their intellect accepts as true, but rather in the form of
        quasi-sensible realities directly apprehended. As his sense of the
        real presence of these objects fluctuates, so the believer alternates
        between warmth and coldness in his faith. Other examples will bring
        this home to one better than abstract description, so I proceed
        immediately to cite some. The first example is a negative one,
        deploring the loss of the sense in question. I have extracted it from
        an account given me by a scientific man of my acquaintance, of his
        religious life. It seems to me to show clearly that the feeling of
        reality may be something more like a sensation than an intellectual
        operation properly so-called.</p>

        unfailing fountain of living justice, truth, and strength, to which I
        instinctively turned at times of weakness, and it always brought me
        out. I know now that it was a personal relation I was in to it,
        because of late years the power of communicating with it has left me,
        and I am conscious of a perfectly definite loss. I used never to fail
        to find it when I turned to it. Then came a set of years when
        sometimes I found it, and then again I would be wholly unable to make
        connection with it. I remember many occasions on which at night in
        bed, I would be unable to get to sleep on account of worry. I turned
        this way and that in the darkness, and groped mentally for the
        familiar sense of that higher mind of my mind which had always seemed
        to be close at hand as it were, closing the passage, and yielding
        support, but there was no electric current. A blank was there instead
        of</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">It</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">: I couldn't find anything. Now, at the age of
        nearly fifty, my power of getting into connection with it has
        entirely left me; and I have to confess that a great help has gone
        out of my life. Life has become curiously dead and indifferent; and I
        can now see that my old experience was probably exactly the same
        thing as the prayers of the orthodox, only I did not call them by
        that name. What I have spoken of as</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">It</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">was

        perception, perhaps, of a living God's existence, swept in and
        overwhelmed the languor of the more ordinary belief. In James Russell

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here is a longer

        the hilltop, where my soul opened out, as it were, into the Infinite,
        and there was a rushing together of the two worlds, the inner and the
        outer. It was deep calling unto deep,—the deep that my own struggle
        had opened up within being answered by the unfathomable deep without,
        reaching beyond the stars. I stood alone with Him who had made me,
        and all the beauty of the world, and love, and sorrow, and even
        temptation. I did not seek Him, but felt the perfect unison of my
        spirit with His. The ordinary sense of things around me faded. For
        the moment nothing but an ineffable joy and exaltation remained. It
        is impossible fully to describe the experience. It was like the
        effect of some great orchestra when all the separate notes have
        melted into one swelling harmony that leaves the listener conscious
        of nothing save that his soul is being wafted upwards, and almost
        bursting with its own emotion. The perfect stillness of the night was
        thrilled by a more solemn silence. The darkness held a presence that
        was all the more felt because it was not seen. I could not any more
        have doubted that</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">He</span></em> <span style="font-size: 90%">was</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">My highest faith in God and truest idea of him
          were then born in me. I have stood upon the Mount of Vision since,
          and felt the Eternal round about me. But never since has there come
          quite the same stirring of the heart. Then, if ever, I believe, I
          stood face to face with God, and was born anew of his spirit. There
          was, as I recall it, no sudden change of thought or of belief,
          except that my early crude conception had, as it were, burst into
          flower. There was no destruction of the old, but a rapid, wonderful
          unfolding. Since that time no discussion that I have heard of the
          proofs of God's existence has been able to shake my faith. Having
          once felt the presence of God's spirit, I have never lost it again
          for long. My most assuring evidence of his existence is deeply
          rooted in that hour of vision, in the memory of that supreme
          experience, and in the conviction, gained from reading and
          reflection, that something the same has come to all who have found
          God. I am aware that it may justly be called mystical. I am not
          enough acquainted with philosophy to defend it from that or any
          other charge. I feel that in writing of it I have overlaid it with
          words rather than put it clearly to your thought. But, such as it
          is, I have described it as carefully as I now am able to
          do.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I was in perfect health: we were on our sixth day of
        tramping, and in good training. We had come the day before from Sixt
        to Trient by Buet. I felt neither fatigue, hunger, nor thirst, and my
        state of mind was equally healthy. I had had at Forlaz good news from
        home; I was subject to no anxiety, either near or remote, for we had
        a good guide, and there was not a shadow of uncertainty about the
        road we should follow. I can best describe the condition in which I
        was by calling it a</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg
        068]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg068"/><span style="font-size: 90%">state of
        equilibrium. When all at once I experienced a feeling of being raised
        above myself, I felt the presence of God—I tell of the thing just as
        I was conscious of it—as if his goodness and his power were
        penetrating me altogether. The throb of emotion was so violent that I
        could barely tell the boys to pass on and not wait for me. I then sat
        down on a stone, unable to stand any longer, and my eyes overflowed
        with tears. I thanked God that in the course of my life he had taught
        me to know him, that he sustained my life and took pity both on the
        insignificant creature and on the sinner that I was. I begged him
        ardently that my life might be consecrated to the doing of his will.
        I felt his reply, which was that I should do his will from day to
        day, in humility and poverty, leaving him, the Almighty God, to be
        judge of whether I should some time be called to bear witness more
        conspicuously. Then, slowly, the ecstasy left my heart; that is, I
        felt that God had withdrawn the communion which he had granted, and I
        was able to walk on, but very slowly, so strongly was I still
        possessed by the interior emotion. Besides, I had wept
        uninterruptedly for several minutes, my eyes were swollen, and I did
        not wish my companions to see me. The state of ecstasy may have
        lasted four or five minutes, although it seemed at the time to last
        much longer. My comrades waited for me ten minutes at the cross of
        Barine, but I took about twenty-five or thirty minutes to join them,
        for as well as I can remember, they said that I had kept them back
        for about half an hour. The impression had been so profound that in
        climbing slowly the slope I asked myself if it were possible that
        Moses on Sinai could have had a more intimate communication with God.
        I think it well to add that in this ecstasy of mine God had neither
        form, color, odor, nor taste; moreover, that the feeling of his
        presence was accompanied with no determinate localization. It was
        rather as if my personality had been transformed by the presence of
        a</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">spiritual
        spirit</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. But the more I seek
        words to express this intimate intercourse, the more I feel the
        impossibility of describing the thing by any of our usual images. At
        bottom the expression most apt to render what I felt is this: God was
        present, though invisible; he fell under no one of my senses, yet my
        consciousness perceived him.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>

        experiences, of which in a later lecture I shall have much to say.
        Meanwhile here is the abridged record of another mystical or
        semi-mystical experience, in a mind evidently framed by nature for
        ardent piety. I owe it to Starbuck's collection. The lady who gives
        the account is the daughter of a man well known in his time as a
        writer against Christianity. The suddenness of her conversion shows
        well how native the sense of God's presence must be to certain minds.
        She relates that she was brought up in entire ignorance of Christian
        doctrine, but, when in Germany, after being talked to by Christian
        friends, she read the Bible and prayed, and finally the plan of

        surround and cover my life.... Once it was when from the summit of a
        high mountain I looked over a gashed and corrugated landscape
        extending to a long convex of ocean that ascended to the horizon, and
        again from the same point when I could see nothing beneath me but a
        boundless expanse of white cloud, on the blown surface of which a few
        high peaks, including the one I was on, seemed plunging about as if
        they were dragging their anchors. What I felt on these occasions was
        a temporary loss of my own identity, accompanied by an illumination
        which revealed to me a deeper significance than I had been wont to
        attach to life. It is in this that I find my justification for saying

        Something over a year ago I was for some weeks in the direst
        perplexity. When the trouble first appeared before me I was dazed,
        but before long (two or three hours) I could hear distinctly a
        passage of Scripture:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">My grace is
        sufficient for thee.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">Every
        time my thoughts turned to the trouble I could hear this quotation. I
        don't think I ever doubted the existence of God, or had him drop out
        of my consciousness. God has frequently stepped into my affairs very
        perceptibly, and I feel that he directs many little details all the
        time. But on two or three occasions he has ordered ways for me very
        contrary to my ambitions and plans.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another statement
        (none the less valuable psychologically for being so decidedly
        childish) is that of a boy of seventeen:—</p>

        of me, singing and reading the Psalms with me.... And then again I
        feel as if I could sit beside him, and put my arms around him, kiss
        him, etc. When I am taking Holy Communion at the altar, I try to get
        with him and generally feel his presence.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such is the human
        ontological imagination, and such is the convincingness of what it
        brings to birth. Unpicturable beings are realized, and realized with
        an intensity almost like that of an hallucination. They determine our
        vital attitude as decisively as the vital attitude of lovers is
        determined by the habitual sense, by which each is haunted, of the
        other being in the world. A lover has notoriously this sense of the
        continuous being of his idol, even when his attention is addressed to
        other matters and he no longer represents her features. He cannot
        forget her; she uninterruptedly affects him through and through.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I spoke of the
        convincingness of these feelings of reality, and I must dwell a
        moment longer on that point. They are as convincing to those who have
        them as any direct sensible experiences can be, and they are, as a
        rule, much more convincing than results established by mere logic
        ever are. One may indeed be entirely without them; probably more than
        one of you here present is without them in any marked degree; but if
        you do have them, and have them at all strongly, the probability is
        that you cannot help regarding them as genuine perceptions of truth,
        as revelations of a kind of reality which no adverse argument,
        however unanswerable by you in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg073"/> words, can expel from your belief. The opinion
        opposed to mysticism in philosophy is sometimes spoken of as
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rationalism</span></em>. Rationalism insists
        that all our beliefs ought ultimately to find for themselves
        articulate grounds. Such grounds, for rationalism, must consist of
        four things: (1) definitely statable abstract principles; (2)
        definite facts of sensation; (3) definite hypotheses based on such
        facts; and (4) definite inferences logically drawn. Vague impressions
        of something indefinable have no place in the rationalistic system,
        which on its positive side is surely a splendid intellectual
        tendency, for not only are all our philosophies fruits of it, but
        physical science (amongst other good things) is its result.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless, if
        we look on man's whole mental life as it exists, on the life of men
        that lies in them apart from their learning and science, and that
        they inwardly and privately follow, we have to confess that the part
        of it of which rationalism can give an account is relatively
        superficial. It is the part that has the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prestige</span></em>
        undoubtedly, for it has the loquacity, it can challenge you for
        proofs, and chop logic, and put you down with words. But it will fail
        to convince or convert you all the same, if your dumb intuitions are
        opposed to its conclusions. If you have intuitions at all, they come
        from a deeper level of your nature than the loquacious level which
        rationalism inhabits. Your whole subconscious life, your impulses,
        your faiths, your needs, your divinations, have prepared the
        premises, of which your consciousness now feels the weight of the
        result; and something in you absolutely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knows</span></em>
        that that result must be truer than any logic-chopping rationalistic
        talk, however clever, that may contradict it. This inferiority of the
        rationalistic level in founding belief is just as manifest when
        rationalism argues for religion as when it argues against it. That
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg074"/> vast literature of proofs of
        God's existence drawn from the order of nature, which a century ago
        seemed so overwhelmingly convincing, to-day does little more than
        gather dust in libraries, for the simple reason that our generation
        has ceased to believe in the kind of God it argued for. Whatever sort
        of a being God may be, we <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></em> to-day that he is nevermore
        that mere external inventor of <span class="tei tei-q">“contrivances”</span> intended to make manifest his
        <span class="tei tei-q">“glory”</span> in which our
        great-grandfathers took such satisfaction, though just how we know
        this we cannot possibly make clear by words either to others or to
        ourselves. I defy any of you here fully to account for your
        persuasion that if a God exist he must be a more cosmic and tragic
        personage than that Being.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The truth is that
        in the metaphysical and religious sphere, articulate reasons are
        cogent for us only when our inarticulate feelings of reality have
        already been impressed in favor of the same conclusion. Then, indeed,
        our intuitions and our reason work together, and great world-ruling
        systems, like that of the Buddhist or of the Catholic philosophy, may
        grow up. Our impulsive belief is here always what sets up the
        original body of truth, and our articulately verbalized philosophy is
        but its showy translation into formulas. The unreasoned and immediate
        assurance is the deep thing in us, the reasoned argument is but a
        surface exhibition. Instinct leads, intelligence does but follow. If
        a person feels the presence of a living God after the fashion shown
        by my quotations, your critical arguments, be they never so superior,
        will vainly set themselves to change his faith.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please observe,
        however, that I do not yet say that it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">better</span></em>
        that the subconscious and non-rational should thus hold primacy in
        the religious realm. I confine myself to simply pointing out that
        they do so hold it as a matter of fact.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg075"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So much for our
        sense of the reality of the religious objects. Let me now say a brief
        word more about the attitudes they characteristically awaken.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have already
        agreed that they are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">solemn</span></em>; and we have seen reason to
        think that the most distinctive of them is the sort of joy which may
        result in extreme cases from absolute self-surrender. The sense of
        the kind of object to which the surrender is made has much to do with
        determining the precise complexion of the joy; and the whole
        phenomenon is more complex than any simple formula allows. In the
        literature of the subject, sadness and gladness have each been
        emphasized in turn. The ancient saying that the first maker of the
        Gods was fear receives voluminous corroboration from every age of
        religious history; but none the less does religious history show the
        part which joy has evermore tended to play. Sometimes the joy has
        been primary; sometimes secondary, being the gladness of deliverance
        from the fear. This latter state of things, being the more complex,
        is also the more complete; and as we proceed, I think we shall have
        abundant reason for refusing to leave out either the sadness or the
        gladness, if we look at religion with the breadth of view which it
        demands. Stated in the completest possible terms, a man's religion
        involves both moods of contraction and moods of expansion of his
        being. But the quantitative mixture and order of these moods vary so
        much from one age of the world, from one system of thought, and from
        one individual to another, that you may insist either on the dread
        and the submission, or on the peace and the freedom as the essence of
        the matter, and still remain materially within the limits of the
        truth. The constitutionally sombre and the constitutionally sanguine
        onlooker are bound to emphasize opposite aspects of what lies before
        their eyes.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg
        076]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg076"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
        constitutionally sombre religious person makes even of his religious
        peace a very sober thing. Danger still hovers in the air about it.
        Flexion and contraction are not wholly checked. It were sparrowlike
        and childish after our deliverance to explode into twittering
        laughter and caper-cutting, and utterly to forget the imminent hawk
        on bough. Lie low, rather, lie low; for you are in the hands of a
        living God. In the Book of Job, for example, the impotence of man and
        the omnipotence of God is the exclusive burden of its author's mind.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“It is as high as heaven; what canst thou
        do?—deeper than hell; what canst thou know?”</span> There is an
        astringent relish about the truth of this conviction which some men
        can feel, and which for them is as near an approach as can be made to
        the feeling of religious joy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we turn to the
        sanguine onlooker, on the other hand, we find that deliverance is
        felt as incomplete unless the burden be altogether overcome and the
        danger forgotten. Such onlookers give us definitions that seem to the
        sombre minds of whom we have just been speaking to leave out all the
        solemnity that makes religious peace so different from merely animal
        joys. In the opinion of some <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg077"/> writers an attitude might be called religious,
        though no touch were left in it of sacrifice or submission, no
        tendency to flexion, no bowing of the head. Any <span class="tei tei-q">“habitual and regulated admiration,”</span> says
        Professor J. R. Seeley,<a href="#note_31" id="noteref_31" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“is worthy to be called a religion”</span>;
        and accordingly he thinks that our Music, our Science, and our
        so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“Civilization,”</span> as these
        things are now organized and admiringly believed in, form the more
        genuine religions of our time. Certainly the unhesitating and
        unreasoning way in which we feel that we must inflict our
        civilization upon <span class="tei tei-q">“lower”</span> races, by
        means of Hotchkiss guns, etc., reminds one of nothing so much as of
        the early spirit of Islam spreading its religion by the sword.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In my last lecture
        I quoted to you the ultra-radical opinion of Mr. Havelock Ellis, that
        laughter of any sort may be considered a religious exercise, for it
        bears witness to the soul's emancipation. I quoted this opinion in
        order to deny its adequacy. But we must now settle our scores more
        carefully with this whole optimistic way of thinking. It is far too
        complex to be decided off-hand. I propose accordingly that we make of
        religious optimism the theme of the next two lectures.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we were to ask
        the question: <span class="tei tei-q">“What is human life's chief
        concern?”</span> one of the answers we should receive would be:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“It is happiness.”</span> How to gain, how to
        keep, how to recover happiness, is in fact for most men at all times
        the secret motive of all they do, and of all they are willing to
        endure. The hedonistic school in ethics deduces the moral life wholly
        from the experiences of happiness and unhappiness which different
        kinds of conduct bring; and, even more in the religious life than in
        the moral life, happiness and unhappiness seem to be the poles round
        which the interest revolves. We need not go so far as to say with the
        author whom I lately quoted that any persistent enthusiasm is, as
        such, religion, nor need we call mere laughter a religious exercise;
        but we must admit that any persistent enjoyment may <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">produce</span></em>
        the sort of religion which consists in a grateful admiration of the
        gift of so happy an existence; and we must also acknowledge that the
        more complex ways of experiencing religion are new manners of
        producing happiness, wonderful inner paths to a supernatural kind of
        happiness, when the first gift of natural existence is unhappy, as it
        so often proves itself to be.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With such
        relations between religion and happiness, it is perhaps not
        surprising that men come to regard the happiness which a religious
        belief affords as a proof of its truth. If a creed makes a man feel
        happy, he almost inevitably adopts it. Such a belief ought to be
        true; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg079"/> therefore it is
        true—such, rightly or wrongly, is one of the <span class="tei tei-q">“immediate inferences”</span> of the religious logic used
        by ordinary men.</p>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the hour
        immediately before us, I shall invite you to consider the simpler
        kinds of religious happiness, leaving the more complex sorts to be
        treated on a later day.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In many persons,
        happiness is congenital and irreclaimable. <span class="tei tei-q">“Cosmic emotion”</span> inevitably takes in them the form
        of enthusiasm and freedom. I speak not only of those who are animally
        happy. I mean those who, when unhappiness is offered or proposed to
        them, positively refuse to feel it, as if it were something mean and
        wrong. We find such persons in every age, passionately flinging
        themselves upon their sense of the goodness of life, in spite of the
        hardships of their own condition, and in spite of the sinister
        theologies into which they may be born. From the outset their
        religion is one of union with the divine. The heretics who went
        before the reformation are lavishly accused by the church writers of
        antinomian practices, just as the first Christians were accused of
        indulgence in orgies by the Romans. It is probable that there never
        has been a century in which the deliberate refusal to think ill of
        life has not been idealized <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg
        080]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg080"/> by
        a sufficient number of persons to form sects, open or secret, who
        claimed all natural things to be permitted. Saint Augustine's maxim,
        <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Dilige et quod vis fac</span></span>,—if you but
        love [God], you may do as you incline,—is morally one of the
        profoundest of observations, yet it is pregnant, for such persons,
        with passports beyond the bounds of conventional morality. According
        to their characters they have been refined or gross; but their belief
        has been at all times systematic enough to constitute a definite
        religious attitude. God was for them a giver of freedom, and the
        sting of evil was overcome. Saint Francis and his immediate disciples
        were, on the whole, of this company of spirits, of which there are of
        course infinite varieties. Rousseau in the earlier years of his
        writing, Diderot, B. de Saint Pierre, and many of the leaders of the
        eighteenth century anti-christian movement were of this optimistic
        type. They owed their influence to a certain authoritativeness in
        their feeling that Nature, if you will only trust her sufficiently,
        is absolutely good.</p>

          occurred to me that any one could derive so much absolute happiness
          from these things as he did. He was very fond of flowers, either
          wild or cultivated; liked all sorts. I think he admired lilacs and
          sunflowers just as much as roses. Perhaps, indeed, no man who ever
          lived liked so many things and disliked so few as Walt Whitman. All
          natural objects seemed to have a charm for him. All sights and
          sounds seemed to please him. He appeared to like (and I believe he
          did like) all the men, women, and children he saw (though I never
          knew him to say that he liked any one), but each who knew him felt
          that he liked him or her, and that he liked others also. I never
          knew him to argue or dispute, and he never spoke about money. He
          always justified, sometimes playfully, sometimes quite seriously,
          those who spoke harshly of himself or his writings, and I often
          thought he even took pleasure in the opposition of enemies. When I
          first knew [him], I used to think that he watched himself, and
          would not allow his tongue to give expression to fretfulness,
          antipathy, complaint, and remonstrance. It did not occur to me as
          possible that these mental states could be absent in him. After
          long observation, however, I satisfied myself that such absence or
          unconsciousness was entirely real. He never spoke deprecatingly of
          any nationality or class of men, or time in the world's history, or
          against any trades or occupations—not even against any animals,
          insects, or inanimate things, nor any of the</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg085"/><span style="font-size: 90%">laws of
          nature, nor any of the results of those laws, such as illness,
          deformity, and death. He never complained or grumbled either at the
          weather, pain, illness, or anything else. He never swore. He could
          not very well, since he never spoke in anger and apparently never
          was angry. He never exhibited fear, and I do not believe he ever
          felt it.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_38" id="noteref_38" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Walt Whitman owes
        his importance in literature to the systematic expulsion from his
        writings of all contractile elements. The only sentiments he allowed
        himself to express were of the expansive order; and he expressed
        these in the first person, not as your mere monstrously conceited
        individual might so express them, but vicariously for all men, so
        that a passionate and mystic ontological emotion suffuses his words,
        and ends by persuading the reader that men and women, life and death,
        and all things are divinely good.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it has come
        about that many persons to-day regard Walt Whitman as the restorer of
        the eternal natural religion. He has infected them with his own love
        of comrades, with his own gladness that he and they exist. Societies
        are actually formed for his cult; a periodical organ exists for its
        propagation, in which the lines of orthodoxy and heterodoxy are
        already beginning to be drawn;<a href="#note_39" id="noteref_39" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a> hymns
        are written by others in his peculiar prosody; and he is even
        explicitly compared with the founder of the Christian religion, not
        altogether to the advantage of the latter.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whitman is often
        spoken of as a <span class="tei tei-q">“pagan.”</span> The word
        nowadays means sometimes the mere natural animal man without a sense
        of sin; sometimes it means a Greek or Roman with his own peculiar
        religious consciousness. In <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg
        086]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg086"/>
        neither of these senses does it fitly define this poet. He is more
        than your mere animal man who has not tasted of the tree of good and
        evil. He is aware enough of sin for a swagger to be present in his
        indifference towards it, a conscious pride in his freedom from
        flexions and contractions, which your genuine pagan in the first
        sense of the word would never show.</p>

        Whitman is less than a Greek or Roman; for their consciousness, even
        in Homeric times, was full to the brim of the sad mortality of this
        sunlit world, and such a consciousness Walt Whitman resolutely
        refuses to adopt. When, for example, Achilles, about to slay Lycaon,
        Priam's young son, hears him sue for mercy, he stops to say:—</p>

        savagely severs the poor boy's neck with his sword, heaves him by the
        foot into the Scamander, and calls to the fishes of the river to eat
        the white fat of Lycaon. Just as here the cruelty and the sympathy
        each <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg087"/> ring true, and do not
        mix or interfere with one another, so did the Greeks and Romans keep
        all their sadnesses and gladnesses unmingled and entire. Instinctive
        good they did not reckon sin; nor had they any such desire to save
        the credit of the universe as to make them insist, as so many of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">us</span></em> insist, that what immediately
        appears as evil must be <span class="tei tei-q">“good in the
        making,”</span> or something equally ingenious. Good was good, and
        bad just bad, for the earlier Greeks. They neither denied the ills of
        nature,—Walt Whitman's verse, <span class="tei tei-q">“What is called
        good is perfect and what is called bad is just as perfect,”</span>
        would have been mere silliness to them,—nor did they, in order to
        escape from those ills, invent <span class="tei tei-q">“another and a
        better world”</span> of the imagination, in which, along with the
        ills, the innocent goods of sense would also find no place. This
        integrity of the instinctive reactions, this freedom from all moral
        sophistry and strain, gives a pathetic dignity to ancient pagan
        feeling. And this quality Whitman's outpourings have not got. His
        optimism is too voluntary and defiant; his gospel has a touch of
        bravado and an affected twist,<a href="#note_42" id="noteref_42" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a> and this
        diminishes its effect on many readers who yet are well disposed
        towards optimism, and on the whole quite willing to admit that in
        important respects Whitman is of the genuine lineage of the
        prophets.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, then, we give
        the name of healthy-mindedness to the tendency which looks on all
        things and sees that they are good, we find that we must distinguish
        between a more involuntary and a more voluntary or systematic way of
        being healthy-minded. In its involuntary variety, healthy-mindedness
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg088"/> is a way of feeling happy
        about things immediately. In its systematical variety, it is an
        abstract way of conceiving things as good. Every abstract way of
        conceiving things selects some one aspect of them as their essence
        for the time being, and disregards the other aspects. Systematic
        healthy-mindedness, conceiving good as the essential and universal
        aspect of being, deliberately excludes evil from its field of vision;
        and although, when thus nakedly stated, this might seem a difficult
        feat to perform for one who is intellectually sincere with himself
        and honest about facts, a little reflection shows that the situation
        is too complex to lie open to so simple a criticism.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first
        place, happiness, like every other emotional state, has blindness and
        insensibility to opposing facts given it as its instinctive weapon
        for self-protection against disturbance. When happiness is actually
        in possession, the thought of evil can no more acquire the feeling of
        reality than the thought of good can gain reality when melancholy
        rules. To the man actively happy, from whatever cause, evil simply
        cannot then and there be believed in. He must ignore it; and to the
        bystander he may then seem perversely to shut his eyes to it and hush
        it up.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But more than
        this: the hushing of it up may, in a perfectly candid and honest
        mind, grow into a deliberate religious policy, or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">parti
        pris</span></span>. Much of what we call evil is due entirely to the
        way men take the phenomenon. It can so often be converted into a
        bracing and tonic good by a simple change of the sufferer's inner
        attitude from one of fear to one of fight; its sting so often departs
        and turns into a relish when, after vainly seeking to shun it, we
        agree to face about and bear it cheerfully, that a man is simply
        bound in honor, with reference to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg089"/> many of the facts that seem at first to
        disconcert his peace, to adopt this way of escape. Refuse to admit
        their badness; despise their power; ignore their presence; turn your
        attention the other way; and so far as you yourself are concerned at
        any rate, though the facts may still exist, their evil character
        exists no longer. Since you make them evil or good by your own
        thoughts about them, it is the ruling of your thoughts which proves
        to be your principal concern.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The deliberate
        adoption of an optimistic turn of mind thus makes its entrance into
        philosophy. And once in, it is hard to trace its lawful bounds. Not
        only does the human instinct for happiness, bent on self-protection
        by ignoring, keep working in its favor, but higher inner ideals have
        weighty words to say. The attitude of unhappiness is not only
        painful, it is mean and ugly. What can be more base and unworthy than
        the pining, puling, mumping mood, no matter by what outward ills it
        may have been engendered? What is more injurious to others? What less
        helpful as a way out of the difficulty? It but fastens and
        perpetuates the trouble which occasioned it, and increases the total
        evil of the situation. At all costs, then, we ought to reduce the
        sway of that mood; we ought to scout it in ourselves and others, and
        never show it tolerance. But it is impossible to carry on this
        discipline in the subjective sphere without zealously emphasizing the
        brighter and minimizing the darker aspects of the objective sphere of
        things at the same time. And thus our resolution not to indulge in
        misery, beginning at a comparatively small point within ourselves,
        may not stop until it has brought the entire frame of reality under a
        systematic conception optimistic enough to be congenial with its
        needs.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all this I say
        nothing of any mystical insight or <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg090"/> persuasion that the total frame of things
        absolutely must be good. Such mystical persuasion plays an enormous
        part in the history of the religious consciousness, and we must look
        at it later with some care. But we need not go so far at present.
        More ordinary non-mystical conditions of rapture suffice for my
        immediate contention. All invasive moral states and passionate
        enthusiasms make one feelingless to evil in some direction. The
        common penalties cease to deter the patriot, the usual prudences are
        flung by the lover to the winds. When the passion is extreme,
        suffering may actually be gloried in, provided it be for the ideal
        cause, death may lose its sting, the grave its victory. In these
        states, the ordinary contrast of good and ill seems to be swallowed
        up in a higher denomination, an omnipotent excitement which engulfs
        the evil, and which the human being welcomes as the crowning
        experience of his life. This, he says, is truly to live, and I exult
        in the heroic opportunity and adventure.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The systematic
        cultivation of healthy-mindedness as a religious attitude is
        therefore consonant with important currents in human nature, and is
        anything but absurd. In fact, we all do cultivate it more or less,
        even when our professed theology should in consistency forbid it. We
        divert our attention from disease and death as much as we can; and
        the slaughter-houses and indecencies without end on which our life is
        founded are huddled out of sight and never mentioned, so that the
        world we recognize officially in literature and in society is a
        poetic fiction far handsomer and cleaner and better than the world
        that really is.<a href="#note_43" id="noteref_43" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg091"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The advance of
        liberalism, so-called, in Christianity, during the past fifty years,
        may fairly be called a victory of healthy-mindedness within the
        church over the morbidness with which the old hell-fire theology was
        more harmoniously related. We have now whole congregations whose
        preachers, far from magnifying our consciousness of sin, seem devoted
        rather to making little of it. They ignore, or even deny, eternal
        punishment, and insist on the dignity rather than on the depravity of
        man. They look at the continual preoccupation of the old-fashioned
        Christian with the salvation of his soul as something sickly and
        reprehensible rather than admirable; and a sanguine and <span class="tei tei-q">“muscular”</span> attitude, which to our forefathers
        would have seemed purely heathen, has become in their eyes an ideal
        element of Christian character. I am not asking whether or not they
        are right, I am only pointing out the change.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The persons to
        whom I refer have still retained for the most part their nominal
        connection with Christianity, in spite of their discarding of its
        more pessimistic theological elements. But in that <span class="tei tei-q">“theory of evolution”</span> which, gathering momentum
        for a century, has within the past twenty-five years swept so rapidly
        over Europe and America, we see the ground laid for a new sort of
        religion of Nature, which has entirely displaced Christianity from
        the thought of a large part of our generation. The idea of a
        universal evolution lends itself to a doctrine of general meliorism
        and progress which fits the religious needs of the healthy-minded so
        well that it seems almost as if it might have been created for their
        use. Accordingly we find <span class="tei tei-q">“evolutionism”</span> interpreted thus optimistically and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg092"/> embraced as a substitute for
        the religion they were born in, by a multitude of our contemporaries
        who have either been trained scientifically, or been fond of reading
        popular science, and who had already begun to be inwardly
        dissatisfied with what seemed to them the harshness and irrationality
        of the orthodox Christian scheme. As examples are better than
        descriptions, I will quote a document received in answer to Professor
        Starbuck's circular of questions. The writer's state of mind may by
        courtesy be called a religion, for it is his reaction on the whole
        nature of things, it is systematic and reflective, and it loyally
        binds him to certain inner ideals. I think you will recognize in him,
        coarse-meated and incapable of wounded spirit as he is, a
        sufficiently familiar contemporary type.</p>

          are as a rule those most lacking in uprightness and morality. The
          men who do not go to church or have any religious convictions are
          the best. Praying, singing of hymns, and sermonizing are

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we are in
        search of a broken and a contrite heart, clearly we need not look to
        this brother. His contentment with the finite incases him like a
        lobster-shell and shields him from all morbid repining at his
        distance from the Infinite. We have in him an excellent example of
        the optimism which may be encouraged by popular
        science.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg
        094]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg094"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To my mind a
        current far more important and interesting religiously than that
        which sets in from natural science towards healthy-mindedness is that
        which has recently poured over America and seems to be gathering
        force every day,—I am ignorant what foothold it may yet have acquired
        in Great Britain,—and to which, for the sake of having a brief
        designation, I will give the title of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Mind-cure movement.”</span> There are various sects of
        this <span class="tei tei-q">“New Thought,”</span> to use another of
        the names by which it calls itself; but their agreements are so
        profound that their differences may be neglected for my present
        purpose, and I will treat the movement, without apology, as if it
        were a simple thing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a
        deliberately optimistic scheme of life, with both a speculative and a
        practical side. In its gradual development during the last quarter of
        a century, it has taken up into itself a number of contributory
        elements, and it must now be reckoned with as a genuine religious
        power. It has reached the stage, for example, when the demand for its
        literature is great enough for insincere stuff, mechanically produced
        for the market, to be to a certain extent supplied by publishers,—a
        phenomenon never observed, I imagine, until a religion has got well
        past its earliest insecure beginnings.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the
        doctrinal sources of Mind-cure is the four Gospels; another is
        Emersonianism or New England transcendentalism; another is Berkeleyan
        idealism; another is spiritism, with its messages of <span class="tei tei-q">“law”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“progress”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“development”</span>; another the optimistic popular
        science evolutionism of which I have recently spoken; and, finally,
        Hinduism has contributed a strain. But the most characteristic
        feature of the mind-cure movement is an inspiration much more direct.
        The leaders in this faith have had an intuitive belief in the
        all-saving power <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg
        095]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg095"/> of
        healthy-minded attitudes as such, in the conquering efficacy of
        courage, hope, and trust, and a correlative contempt for doubt, fear,
        worry, and all nervously precautionary states of mind.<a href="#note_44" id="noteref_44" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a> Their
        belief has in a general way been corroborated by the practical
        experience of their disciples; and this experience forms to-day a
        mass imposing in amount.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The blind have
        been made to see, the halt to walk; lifelong invalids have had their
        health restored. The moral fruits have been no less remarkable. The
        deliberate adoption of a healthy-minded attitude has proved possible
        to many who never supposed they had it in them; regeneration of
        character has gone on on an extensive scale; and cheerfulness has
        been restored to countless homes. The indirect influence of this has
        been great. The mind-cure principles are beginning so to pervade the
        air that one catches their spirit at second-hand. One hears of the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Gospel of Relaxation,”</span> of the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Don't Worry Movement,”</span> of people who
        repeat to themselves, <span class="tei tei-q">“Youth, health,
        vigor!”</span> when dressing in the morning, as their motto for the
        day. Complaints of the weather are getting to be forbidden in many
        households; and more and more people are recognizing it to be bad
        form to speak of disagreeable sensations, or to make much of the
        ordinary inconveniences and ailments of life. These general tonic
        effects on public opinion would be good even if the more striking
        results were non-existent. But the latter abound so that we can
        afford to overlook the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg
        096]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg096"/>
        innumerable failures and self-deceptions that are mixed in with them
        (for in everything human failure is a matter of course), and we can
        also overlook the verbiage of a good deal of the mind-cure
        literature, some of which is so moonstruck with optimism and so
        vaguely expressed that an academically trained intellect finds it
        almost impossible to read it at all.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The plain fact
        remains that the spread of the movement has been due to practical
        fruits, and the extremely practical turn of character of the American
        people has never been better shown than by the fact that this, their
        only decidedly original contribution to the systematic philosophy of
        life, should be so intimately knit up with concrete therapeutics. To
        the importance of mind-cure the medical and clerical professions in
        the United States are beginning, though with much recalcitrancy and
        protesting, to open their eyes. It is evidently bound to develop
        still farther, both speculatively and practically, and its latest
        writers are far and away the ablest of the group.<a href="#note_45" id="noteref_45" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a> It
        matters nothing that, just as there are hosts of persons who cannot
        pray, so there are greater hosts who cannot by any possibility be
        influenced by the mind-curers' ideas. For our immediate purpose, the
        important point is that so large a number should exist who <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></em> be so
        influenced. They form a psychic type to be studied with
        respect.<a href="#note_46" id="noteref_46" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg097"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To come now to a
        little closer quarters with their creed. The fundamental pillar on
        which it rests is nothing more than the general basis of all
        religious experience, the fact that man has a dual nature, and is
        connected with two spheres of thought, a shallower and a profounder
        sphere, in either of which he may learn to live more habitually. The
        shallower and lower sphere is that of the fleshly sensations,
        instincts, and desires, of egotism, doubt, and the lower personal
        interests. But whereas Christian theology has always considered

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Their notion of
        man's higher nature is hardly less divergent, being decidedly
        pantheistic. The spiritual in man appears in the mind-cure philosophy
        as partly conscious, but chiefly subconscious; and through the
        subconscious part of it we are already one with the Divine without
        any miracle of grace, or abrupt creation of a new inner man. As this
        view is variously expressed by different writers, we find in it
        traces of Christian mysticism, of transcendental idealism, of
        vedantism, and of the modern psychology of the subliminal self. A
        quotation or two will put us at the central point of view:—</p>

        spirit of infinite life and power that is back of all, that manifests

        that is back of all is what I call God. I care not what term you may

        all is from Him and in Him, and there is nothing that is outside. He
        is the life of our life, our very life itself. We are partakers of
        the life of God; and though we differ from Him in that we are
        individualized spirits, while He is the Infinite Spirit, including
        us, as well as all else beside, yet in essence the life of God and

          into a conscious vital realization of our oneness with this

          inflow. In just the degree that we come into a conscious
          realization of our oneness with the Infinite Life, and open
          ourselves to this divine inflow, do we actualize in ourselves the
          qualities and powers of the Infinite Life, do we make ourselves
          channels through which the Infinite Intelligence and Power can
          work. In just the degree in which you realize your oneness with the
          Infinite Spirit, you will exchange dis-ease for ease, inharmony for
          harmony, suffering and pain for abounding health and strength. To
          recognize our own divinity, and our intimate relation to the
          Universal, is to attach the belts of our machinery to the
          powerhouse of the Universe. One need remain in hell no longer than
          one chooses to; we can rise to any heaven we ourselves choose; and

          spirit, just one with God's Thought of me,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">and
          slept all night without waking, for the first time in several years
          [the distress-turns had usually recurred about two o'clock in the
          night]. I felt the next day like an escaped prisoner, and believed
          I had found the secret that would in time give me perfect health.
          Within ten days I was able to eat anything provided for others, and
          after two weeks I began to have my own positive mental suggestions
          of Truth,</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg
          105]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg105"/><span style="font-size: 90%">which were to me
          like stepping-stones. I will note a few of them; they came about
          two weeks apart.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">1st. I am Soul, therefore it is well with
          me.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">2d. I am Soul, therefore I</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">am</span></em> <span style="font-size: 90%">well.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">3d. A sort of inner vision of myself as a
          four-footed beast with a protuberance on every part of my body
          where I had suffering, with my own face, begging me to acknowledge
          it as myself. I resolutely fixed my attention on being well, and
          refused to even look at my old self in this form.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">4th. Again the vision of the beast far in the

          acknowledge.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">5th. Once more the vision, but only of my eyes
          with the longing look; and again the refusal. Then came the
          conviction, the inner consciousness, that I was perfectly well and
          always had been, for I was Soul, an expression of God's Perfect
          Thought. That was to me the perfect and completed separation
          between what I was and what I appeared to be. I succeeded in never
          losing sight after this of my real being, by constantly affirming
          this truth, and by degrees (though it took me two years of hard
          work to get there)</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">I expressed health
          continuously throughout my whole body</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">.</span></span></p>

          never known this Truth to fail when I applied it, though in my

          child.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But I fear that I
        risk tiring you by so many examples, and I must lead you back to
        philosophic generalities again. You see already by such records of
        experience how impossible it is not to class mind-cure as primarily a
        religious movement. Its doctrine of the oneness of our life with
        God's life is in fact quite indistinguishable from an interpretation
        of Christ's message which in these very Gifford lectures has been
        defended by some of your very ablest Scottish religious
        philosophers.<a href="#note_52" id="noteref_52" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg106"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But philosophers
        usually profess to give a quasi-logical explanation of the existence
        of evil, whereas of the general fact of evil in the world, the
        existence of the selfish, suffering, timorous finite consciousness,
        the mind-curers, so far as I am acquainted with them, profess to give
        no speculative explanation. Evil is empirically there for them as it
        is for everybody, but the practical point of view predominates, and
        it would ill agree with the spirit of their system to spend time in
        worrying over it as a <span class="tei tei-q">“mystery”</span> or
        <span class="tei tei-q">“problem,”</span> or in <span class="tei tei-q">“laying to heart”</span> the lesson of its experience,
        after the manner of the Evangelicals. Don't reason about it, as Dante
        says, but give a glance and pass beyond! It is Avidhya, ignorance!
        something merely to be outgrown and left behind, transcended and
        forgotten. Christian Science so-called, the sect of Mrs. Eddy, is the
        most radical branch of mind-cure in its dealings with evil. For it
        evil is simply a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lie</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg107"/> and any one who mentions it is a liar. The
        optimistic ideal of duty forbids us to pay it the compliment even of
        explicit attention. Of course, as our next lectures will show us,
        this is a bad speculative omission, but it is intimately linked with
        the practical merits of the system we are examining. Why regret a
        philosophy of evil, a mind-curer would ask us, if I can put you in
        possession of a life of good?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After all, it is
        the life that tells; and mind-cure has developed a living system of
        mental hygiene which may well claim to have thrown all previous
        literature of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Diätetik der Seele</span></span> into the shade.
        This system is wholly and exclusively compacted of optimism:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Pessimism leads to weakness. Optimism leads
        to power.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Thoughts are
        things,”</span> as one of the most vigorous mind-cure writers prints
        in bold type at the bottom of each of his pages; and if your thoughts
        are of health, youth, vigor, and success, before you know it these
        things will also be your outward portion. No one can fail of the
        regenerative influence of optimistic thinking, pertinaciously
        pursued. Every man owns indefeasibly this inlet to the divine. Fear,
        on the contrary, and all the contracted and egoistic modes of
        thought, are inlets to destruction. Most mind-curers here bring in a
        doctrine that thoughts are <span class="tei tei-q">“forces,”</span>
        and that, by virtue of a law that like attracts like, one man's
        thoughts draw to themselves as allies all the thoughts of the same
        character that exist the world over. Thus one gets, by one's
        thinking, reinforcements from elsewhere for the realization of one's
        desires; and the great point in the conduct of life is to get the
        heavenly forces on one's side by opening one's own mind to their
        influx.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the whole, one
        is struck by a psychological similarity between the mind-cure
        movement and the Lutheran <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg
        108]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg108"/> and
        Wesleyan movements. To the believer in moralism and works, with his
        anxious query, <span class="tei tei-q">“What shall I do to be
        saved?”</span> Luther and Wesley replied: <span class="tei tei-q">“You are saved now, if you would but believe it.”</span>
        And the mind-curers come with precisely similar words of
        emancipation. They speak, it is true, to persons for whom the
        conception of salvation has lost its ancient theological meaning, but
        who labor nevertheless with the same eternal human difficulty.
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Things are
        wrong with them</span></em>; and <span class="tei tei-q">“What shall
        I do to be clear, right, sound, whole, well?”</span> is the form of
        their question. And the answer is: <span class="tei tei-q">“You
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em> well, sound, and clear already,
        if you did but know it.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The whole
        matter may be summed up in one sentence,”</span> says one of the
        authors whom I have already quoted, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">God is well, and so are you</span></em>. You
        must awaken to the knowledge of your real being.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The adequacy of
        their message to the mental needs of a large fraction of mankind is
        what gave force to those earlier gospels. Exactly the same adequacy
        holds in the case of the mind-cure message, foolish as it may sound
        upon its surface; and seeing its rapid growth in influence, and its
        therapeutic triumphs, one is tempted to ask whether it may not be
        destined (probably by very reason of the crudity and extravagance of
        many of its manifestations<a href="#note_53" id="noteref_53" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a>) to play
        a part almost as great in the evolution of the popular religion of
        the future as did those earlier movements in their day.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But I here fear
        that I may begin to <span class="tei tei-q">“jar upon the
        nerves”</span> of some of the members of this academic audience. Such
        contemporary vagaries, you may think, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg109"/> should hardly take so large a place in
        dignified Gifford lectures. I can only beseech you to have patience.
        The whole outcome of these lectures will, I imagine, be the
        emphasizing to your mind of the enormous diversities which the
        spiritual lives of different men exhibit. Their wants, their
        susceptibilities, and their capacities all vary and must be classed
        under different heads. The result is that we have really different
        types of religious experience; and, seeking in these lectures closer
        acquaintance with the healthy-minded type, we must take it where we
        find it in most radical form. The psychology of individual types of
        character has hardly begun even to be sketched as yet—our lectures
        may possibly serve as a crumb-like contribution to the structure. The
        first thing to bear in mind (especially if we ourselves belong to the
        clerico-academic-scientific type, the officially and conventionally
        <span class="tei tei-q">“correct”</span> type, <span class="tei tei-q">“the deadly respectable”</span> type, for which to ignore
        others is a besetting temptation) is that nothing can be more stupid
        than to bar out phenomena from our notice, merely because we are
        incapable of taking part in anything like them ourselves.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now the history of
        Lutheran salvation by faith, of methodistic conversions, and of what
        I call the mind-cure movement seems to prove the existence of
        numerous persons in whom—at any rate at a certain stage in their
        development—a change of character for the better, so far from being
        facilitated by the rules laid down by official moralists, will take
        place all the more successfully if those rules be exactly reversed.
        Official moralists advise us never to relax our strenuousness.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Be vigilant, day and night,”</span> they
        adjure us; <span class="tei tei-q">“hold your passive tendencies in
        check; shrink from no effort; keep your will like a bow always
        bent.”</span> But the persons I speak of find that all this conscious
        effort leads to nothing but failure <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg110"/> and vexation in their hands, and only makes
        them two-fold more the children of hell they were before. The tense
        and voluntary attitude becomes in them an impossible fever and
        torment. Their machinery refuses to run at all when the bearings are
        made so hot and the belts so tight.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under these
        circumstances the way to success, as vouched for by innumerable
        authentic personal narrations, is by an anti-moralistic method, by
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“surrender”</span> of which I spoke in my
        second lecture. Passivity, not activity; relaxation, not intentness,
        should be now the rule. Give up the feeling of responsibility, let go
        your hold, resign the care of your destiny to higher powers, be
        genuinely indifferent as to what becomes of it all, and you will find
        not only that you gain a perfect inward relief, but often also, in
        addition, the particular goods you sincerely thought you were
        renouncing. This is the salvation through self-despair, the dying to
        be truly born, of Lutheran theology, the passage into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nothing</span></em>
        of which Jacob Behmen writes. To get to it, a critical point must
        usually be passed, a corner turned within one. Something must give
        way, a native hardness must break down and liquefy; and this event
        (as we shall abundantly see hereafter) is frequently sudden and
        automatic, and leaves on the Subject an impression that he has been
        wrought on by an external power.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever its
        ultimate significance may prove to be, this is certainly one
        fundamental form of human experience. Some say that the capacity or
        incapacity for it is what divides the religious from the merely
        moralistic character. With those who undergo it in its fullness, no
        criticism avails to cast doubt on its reality. They <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></em>; for
        they have actually <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">felt</span></em> the higher powers, in giving up
        the tension of their personal will.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg111"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A story which
        revivalist preachers often tell is that of a man who found himself at
        night slipping down the side of a precipice. At last he caught a
        branch which stopped his fall, and remained clinging to it in misery
        for hours. But finally his fingers had to loose their hold, and with
        a despairing farewell to life, he let himself drop. He fell just six
        inches. If he had given up the struggle earlier, his agony would have
        been spared. As the mother earth received him, so, the preachers tell
        us, will the everlasting arms receive <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">us</span></em> if we
        confide absolutely in them, and give up the hereditary habit of
        relying on our personal strength, with its precautions that cannot
        shelter and safeguards that never save.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mind-curers
        have given the widest scope to this sort of experience. They have
        demonstrated that a form of regeneration by relaxing, by letting go,
        psychologically indistinguishable from the Lutheran justification by
        faith and the Wesleyan acceptance of free grace, is within the reach
        of persons who have no conviction of sin and care nothing for the
        Lutheran theology. It is but giving your little private convulsive
        self a rest, and finding that a greater Self is there. The results,
        slow or sudden, or great or small, of the combined optimism and
        expectancy, the regenerative phenomena which ensue on the abandonment
        of effort, remain firm facts of human nature, no matter whether we
        adopt a theistic, a pantheistic-idealistic, or a
        medical-materialistic view of their ultimate causal
        explanation.<a href="#note_54" id="noteref_54" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg112"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When we take up
        the phenomena of revivalistic conversion, we shall learn something
        more about all this. Meanwhile I will say a brief word about the
        mind-curer's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">methods</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They are of course
        largely suggestive. The suggestive influence of environment plays an
        enormous part in all spiritual education. But the word <span class="tei tei-q">“suggestion,”</span> having acquired official status, is
        unfortunately already beginning to play in many quarters the part of
        a wet blanket upon investigation, being used to fend off all inquiry
        into the varying susceptibilities of individual cases. <span class="tei tei-q">“Suggestion”</span> is only another name for the power of
        ideas, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">so
        far as they prove efficacious over belief and conduct</span></em>.
        Ideas efficacious over some people prove inefficacious over others.
        Ideas efficacious at some times and in some human surroundings are
        not so at other times and elsewhere. The ideas of Christian churches
        are not efficacious in the therapeutic direction to-day, whatever
        they may have been in earlier centuries; and when the whole question
        is as to why the salt has lost its savor here or gained it there, the
        mere blank waving of the word <span class="tei tei-q">“suggestion”</span> as if it were a banner gives no
        light. Dr. Goddard, whose candid psychological essay on Faith Cures
        ascribes them to nothing but ordinary suggestion, concludes by saying
        that <span class="tei tei-q">“Religion [and by this he seems to mean
        our popular Christianity] has in it all there is in mental
        therapeutics, and has it in its best form. Living up to [our
        religious] ideas will do anything for us that can be done.”</span>
        And this in spite of the actual fact that the popular Christianity
        does absolutely <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg
        113]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg113"/>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nothing</span></em>, or did nothing until
        mind-cure came to the rescue.<a href="#note_55" id="noteref_55" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An idea, to be
        suggestive, must come to the individual with the force of a
        revelation. The mind-cure with its gospel of healthy-mindedness has
        come as a revelation to many whose hearts the church Christianity had
        left hardened. It has let loose their springs of higher life.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg114"/> In what can the originality of
        any religious movement consist, save in finding a channel, until then
        sealed up, through which those springs may be set free in some group
        of human beings?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The force of
        personal faith, enthusiasm, and example, and above all the force of
        novelty, are always the prime suggestive agency in this kind of
        success. If mind-cure should ever become official, respectable, and
        intrenched, these elements of suggestive efficacy will be lost. In
        its acuter stages every religion must be a homeless Arab of the
        desert. The church knows this well enough, with its everlasting inner
        struggle of the acute religion of the few against the chronic
        religion of the many, indurated into an obstructiveness worse than
        that which irreligion opposes to the movings of the Spirit.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“We may pray,”</span> says Jonathan Edwards,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“concerning all those saints that are not
        lively Christians, that they may either be enlivened, or taken away;
        if that be true that is often said by some at this day, that these
        cold dead saints do more hurt than natural men, and lead more souls
        to hell, and that it would be well for mankind if they were all
        dead.”</span><a href="#note_56" id="noteref_56" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next condition
        of success is the apparent existence, in large numbers, of minds who
        unite healthy-mindedness with readiness for regeneration by letting
        go. Protestantism has been too pessimistic as regards the natural
        man, Catholicism has been too legalistic and moralistic, for either
        the one or the other to appeal in any generous way to the type of
        character formed of this peculiar mingling of elements. However few
        of us here present may belong to such a type, it is now evident that
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg115"/> it forms a specific moral
        combination, well represented in the world.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, mind-cure
        has made what in our protestant countries is an unprecedentedly great
        use of the subconscious life. To their reasoned advice and dogmatic
        assertion, its founders have added systematic exercise in passive
        relaxation, concentration, and meditation, and have even invoked
        something like hypnotic practice. I quote some passages at

          the thought is not occupied with one's daily duty or profession, it
          should be sent aloft into the spiritual atmosphere. There are quiet
          leisure moments by day, and wakeful hours at night, when this

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When we reach the
        subject of mysticism, you will undergo so deep an immersion into
        these exalted states of consciousness as to be wet all over, if I may
        so express myself; and the cold shiver of doubt with which this
        little sprinkling may affect you will have long since passed
        away—doubt, I mean, as to whether all such writing be not mere
        abstract talk and rhetoric set down <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">pour
        encourager les autres</span></span>. You will then be convinced, I
        trust, that these states of consciousness of <span class="tei tei-q">“union”</span> form a perfectly definite class of
        experiences, of which the soul may occasionally partake, and which
        certain persons may live by in a deeper sense than they live by
        anything else with which they have acquaintance. This brings me to a
        general philosophical reflection with which I should like to pass
        from the subject of healthy-mindedness, and close a topic which I
        fear is already only too long drawn out. It concerns the relation of
        all this systematized healthy-mindedness and mind-cure religion to
        scientific method and the scientific life.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a later lecture
        I shall have to treat explicitly of the relation of religion to
        science on the one hand, and to primeval savage thought on the other.
        There are plenty of persons to-day—<span class="tei tei-q">“scientists”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“positivists,”</span> they are fond of calling
        themselves—who will tell you that religious thought is a mere
        survival, an atavistic reversion to a type of consciousness which
        humanity in its more enlightened examples has long since left behind
        and outgrown. If you ask them to explain themselves more fully, they
        will probably say that for primitive thought <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg119"/> everything is conceived of under the form of
        personality. The savage thinks that things operate by personal
        forces, and for the sake of individual ends. For him, even external
        nature obeys individual needs and claims, just as if these were so
        many elementary powers. Now science, on the other hand, these
        positivists say, has proved that personality, so far from being an
        elementary force in nature, is but a passive resultant of the really
        elementary forces, physical, chemical, physiological, and
        psycho-physical, which are all impersonal and general in character.
        Nothing individual accomplishes anything in the universe save in so
        far as it obeys and exemplifies some universal law. Should you then
        inquire of them by what means science has thus supplanted primitive
        thought, and discredited its personal way of looking at things, they
        would undoubtedly say it has been by the strict use of the method of
        experimental verification. Follow out science's conceptions
        practically, they will say, the conceptions that ignore personality
        altogether, and you will always be corroborated. The world is so made
        that all your expectations will be experientially verified so long,
        and only so long, as you keep the terms from which you infer them
        impersonal and universal.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But here we have
        mind-cure, with her diametrically opposite philosophy, setting up an
        exactly identical claim. Live as if I were true, she says, and every
        day will practically prove you right. That the controlling energies
        of nature are personal, that your own personal thoughts are forces,
        that the powers of the universe will directly respond to your
        individual appeals and needs, are propositions which your whole
        bodily and mental experience will verify. And that experience does
        largely verify these primeval religious ideas is proved by the fact
        that the mind-cure movement spreads as it does, not by proclamation
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg120"/> and assertion simply, but by
        palpable experiential results. Here, in the very heyday of science's
        authority, it carries on an aggressive warfare against the scientific
        philosophy, and succeeds by using science's own peculiar methods and
        weapons. Believing that a higher power will take care of us in
        certain ways better than we can take care of ourselves, if we only
        genuinely throw ourselves upon it and consent to use it, it finds the
        belief, not only not impugned, but corroborated by its
        observation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How conversions
        are thus made, and converts confirmed, is evident enough from the
        narratives which I have quoted. I will quote yet another couple of
        shorter ones to give the matter a perfectly concrete turn. Here is
        one:—</p>

        was two months after I first saw the healer. I fell, spraining my
        right ankle, which I had done once four years before, having then had
        to use a crutch and elastic anklet for some months, and carefully
        guarding it ever since. As soon as I was on my feet I made the
        positive suggestion (and felt it through all my being):</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">There is
        nothing but God, all life comes from him perfectly. I cannot be
        sprained or hurt, I will let him take care of
          it.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">Well, I never had a sensation in it, and I walked

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next case not
        only illustrates experiment and verification, but also the element of

        attack of influenza. I thought that I was going to have the grippe,

        myself. On my way home I met a friend, and I refrained with some
        effort from telling her how I felt. That was the first step gained. I
        went to bed immediately, and my husband wished to send for the
        doctor. But I told him that I would rather wait until morning and see

        them, if we have anything at all, we have the method of experiment
        and verification. For the point I am driving at now, it makes no
        difference whether you consider the patients to be deluded victims of
        their imagination or not. That they seemed to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">themselves</span></em> to have been cured by the
        experiments tried was enough to make them converts to the system. And
        although it is evident that one must be of a certain mental mould to
        get such results (for not every one can get thus cured to his own
        satisfaction any more than every one can be cured by the first
        regular practitioner whom he calls in), yet it would surely be
        pedantic and over-scrupulous for those who <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></em> get
        their savage and primitive philosophy of mental healing verified
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg122"/> in such experimental ways as
        this, to give them up at word of command for more scientific
        therapeutics. What are we to think of all this? Has science made too
        wide a claim?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I believe that the
        claims of the sectarian scientist are, to say the least, premature.
        The experiences which we have been studying during this hour (and a
        great many other kinds of religious experiences are like them)
        plainly show the universe to be a more many-sided affair than any
        sect, even the scientific sect, allows for. What, in the end, are all
        our verifications but experiences that agree with more or less
        isolated systems of ideas (conceptual systems) that our minds have
        framed? But why in the name of common sense need we assume that only
        one such system of ideas can be true? The obvious outcome of our
        total experience is that the world can be handled according to many
        systems of ideas, and is so handled by different men, and will each
        time give some characteristic kind of profit, for which he cares, to
        the handler, while at the same time some other kind of profit has to
        be omitted or postponed. Science gives to all of us telegraphy,
        electric lighting, and diagnosis, and succeeds in preventing and
        curing a certain amount of disease. Religion in the shape of
        mind-cure gives to some of us serenity, moral poise, and happiness,
        and prevents certain forms of disease as well as science does, or
        even better in a certain class of persons. Evidently, then, the
        science and the religion are both of them genuine keys for unlocking
        the world's treasure-house to him who can use either of them
        practically. Just as evidently neither is exhaustive or exclusive of
        the other's simultaneous use. And why, after all, may not the world
        be so complex as to consist of many interpenetrating spheres of
        reality, which we can thus approach in alternation by using different
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg123"/> conceptions and assuming
        different attitudes, just as mathematicians handle the same numerical
        and spatial facts by geometry, by analytical geometry, by algebra, by
        the calculus, or by quaternions, and each time come out right? On
        this view religion and science, each verified in its own way from
        hour to hour and from life to life, would be co-eternal. Primitive
        thought, with its belief in individualized personal forces, seems at
        any rate as far as ever from being driven by science from the field
        to-day. Numbers of educated people still find it the directest
        experimental channel by which to carry on their intercourse with
        reality.<a href="#note_65" id="noteref_65" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a></p>

          and one of the first results of my illness, a dozen years before,
          had been a diplopia which deprived me of the use of my eyes for
          reading and writing almost entirely, while a later one had been to
          shut me out from exercise of any kind under penalty of</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg124"/><span style="font-size: 90%">immediate and great exhaustion. I had been under
          the care of doctors of the highest standing both in Europe and
          America, men in whose power to help me I had had great faith, with
          no or ill result. Then, at a time when I seemed to be rather
          rapidly losing ground, I heard some things that gave me interest
          enough in mental healing to make me try it; I had no great hope of
          getting any good from it—it was a</span> <em class="tei tei-emph">
<span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">chance</span></em>
<span style="font-size: 90%">I tried, partly because my thought
            was interested by the new possibility it seemed to open, partly
            because it was the only chance I then could see. I went to X. in
            Boston, from whom some friends of mine had got, or thought that
            they had got, great help; the treatment was a silent one; little
            was said, and that little carried no conviction to my mind;
            whatever influence was exerted was that of another person's
            thought or feeling silently projected on to my unconscious mind,
            into my nervous system as it were, as we sat still together. I
            believed from the start in the</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">possibility</span></em>
<span style="font-size: 90%">of such action, for I knew the power
            of the mind to shape, helping or hindering, the body's
            nerve-activities, and I thought telepathy probable, although
            unproved, but I had no belief in it as more than a possibility,
            and no strong conviction nor any mystic or religious faith
            connected with my thought of it that might have brought
            imagination strongly into play.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I sat quietly with the healer for half an hour
            each day, at first with no result; then, after ten days or so, I
            became quite suddenly and swiftly conscious of a tide of new
            energy rising within me, a sense of power to pass beyond old
            halting-places, of power to break the bounds that, though often
            tried before, had long been veritable walls about my life, too
            high to climb. I began to read and walk as I had not done for
            years, and the change was sudden, marked, and unmistakable. This
            tide seemed to mount for some weeks, three or four perhaps, when,
            summer having come, I came away, taking the treatment up again a
            few months later. The lift I got proved permanent, and left me
            slowly gaining ground instead of losing it, but with this lift
            the influence seemed in a way to have spent itself, and, though
            my confidence in the reality of the power had gained immensely
            from this first experience, and should have helped me to make
            further gain in health and strength if my belief in</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg125"/><span style="font-size: 90%">it had been the potent factor there, I never
            after this got any result at all as striking or as clearly marked
            as this which came when I made trial of it first, with little
            faith and doubtful expectation. It is difficult to put all the
            evidence in such a matter into words, to gather up into a
            distinct statement all that one bases one's conclusions on, but I
            have always felt that I had abundant evidence to justify (to
            myself, at least) the conclusion that I came to then, and since
            have held to, that the physical change which came at that time
            was, first, the result of a change wrought within me by a change
            of mental state; and, secondly, that that change of mental state
            was not, save in a very secondary way, brought about through the
            influence of an excited imagination, or a</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">consciously</span></em>
<span style="font-size: 90%">received suggestion of an hypnotic
            sort. Lastly, I believe that this change was the result of my
            receiving telepathically, and upon a mental stratum quite below
            the level of immediate consciousness, a healthier and more
            energetic attitude, receiving it from another person whose
            thought was directed upon me with the intention of impressing the
            idea of this attitude upon me. In my case the disease was
            distinctly what would be classed as nervous, not organic; but
            from such opportunities as I have had of observing, I have come
            to the conclusion that the dividing line that has been drawn is
            an arbitrary one, the nerves controlling the internal activities
            and the nutrition of the body throughout; and I believe that the
            central nervous system, by starting and inhibiting local centres,
            can exercise a vast influence upon disease of any kind, if it can
            be brought to bear. In my judgment the question is simply how to
            bring it to bear, and I think that the uncertainty and remarkable
            differences in the results obtained through mental healing do but
            show how ignorant we are as yet of the forces at work and of the
            means we should take to make them effective. That these results
            are not due to chance coincidences my observation of myself and
            others makes me sure; that the conscious mind, the imagination,
            enters into them as a factor in many cases is doubtless true, but
            in many others, and sometimes very extraordinary ones, it hardly
            seems to enter in at all. On the whole I am inclined to think
            that as the healing action, like the morbid one, springs from the
            plane</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg

            faith and hardly any hope (possibly owing to a previous
            unsuccessful experience with a Christian Scientist), our little
            daughter was placed under the care of a healer, and cured of a
            trouble about which the physician had been very discouraging in
            his diagnosis. This interested me, and I began studying earnestly
            the method and philosophy of this method of healing. Gradually an
            inner peace and tranquillity came to me in so positive a way that
            my manner changed greatly. My children and friends noticed the
            change and commented upon it. All feelings of irritability
            disappeared. Even the expression of my face changed
            noticeably.</span></span></p>

            a sick headache induced, as I then supposed, by dyspepsia and
            catarrh. I grew serene and gentle, and the physical troubles
            entirely disappeared. I had been in the habit of approaching

<span style="font-size: 173%">Lectures VI And VII. The Sick
        Soul.</span></h1>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At our last
        meeting, we considered the healthy-minded temperament, the
        temperament which has a constitutional incapacity for prolonged
        suffering, and in which the tendency to see things optimistically is
        like a water of crystallization in which the individual's character
        is set. We saw how this temperament may become the basis for a
        peculiar type of religion, a religion in which good, even the good of
        this world's life, is regarded as the essential thing for a rational
        being to attend to. This religion directs him to settle his scores
        with the more evil aspects of the universe by systematically
        declining to lay them to heart or make much of them, by ignoring them
        in his reflective calculations, or even, on occasion, by denying
        outright that they exist. Evil is a disease; and worry over disease
        is itself an additional form of disease, which only adds to the
        original complaint. Even repentance and remorse, affections which
        come in the character of ministers of good, may be but sickly and
        relaxing impulses. The best repentance is to up and act for
        righteousness, and forget that you ever had relations with sin.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Spinoza's
        philosophy has this sort of healthy-mindedness woven into the heart
        of it, and this has been one secret of its fascination. He whom
        Reason leads, according to Spinoza, is led altogether by the
        influence over his mind of good. Knowledge of evil is an <span class="tei tei-q">“inadequate”</span> knowledge, fit only for slavish
        minds. So Spinoza <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg
        128]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg128"/>
        categorically condemns repentance. When men make mistakes, he
        says,—</p>

        repentance to help to bring them on the right path, and might
        thereupon conclude (as every one does conclude) that these affections
        are good things. Yet when we look at the matter closely, we shall
        find that not only are they not good, but on the contrary deleterious
        and evil passions. For it is manifest that we can always get along
        better by reason and love of truth than by worry of conscience and
        remorse. Harmful are these and evil, inasmuch as they form a
        particular kind of sadness; and the disadvantages of

        strive to keep it from our life. Just so we should endeavor, since
        uneasiness of conscience and remorse are of this kind of complexion,
        to flee and shun these states of mind.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_66" id="noteref_66" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Within the
        Christian body, for which repentance of sins has from the beginning
        been the critical religious act, healthy-mindedness has always come
        forward with its milder interpretation. Repentance according to such
        healthy-minded Christians means <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">getting away from</span></em> the sin, not
        groaning and writhing over its commission. The Catholic practice of
        confession and absolution is in one of its aspects little more than a
        systematic method of keeping healthy-mindedness on top. By it a man's
        accounts with evil are periodically squared and audited, so that he
        may start the clean page with no old debts inscribed. Any Catholic
        will tell us how clean and fresh and free he feels after the purging
        operation. Martin Luther by no means belonged to the healthy-minded
        type in the radical sense in which we have discussed it, and he
        repudiated priestly absolution for sin. Yet in this matter of
        repentance he had some very healthy-minded <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg129"/> ideas, due in the main to the largeness of his
        conception of God.</p>

        says,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I thought that
        I was utterly cast away, if at any time I felt the lust of the flesh:
        that is to say, if I felt any evil motion, fleshly lust, wrath,
        hatred, or envy against any brother. I assayed many ways to help to
        quiet my conscience, but it would not be; for the concupiscence and
        lust of my flesh did always return, so that I could not rest, but was
        continually vexed with these thoughts: This or that sin thou hast
        committed: thou art infected with envy, with impatiency, and such
        other sins: therefore thou art entered into this holy order in vain,
        and all thy good works are unprofitable. But if then I had rightly
        understood these sentences of Paul:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">The flesh lusteth contrary to the Spirit, and the
        Spirit contrary to the flesh; and these two are one against another,

          do,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">I should not have so miserably tormented myself,

          shalt not utterly be without sin, for thou hast flesh; thou shalt

          remember that Staupitz was wont to say,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I have vowed unto God above a thousand times that
          I would become a better man: but I never performed that which I
          vowed. Hereafter I will make no such vow: for I have now learned by
          experience that I am not able to perform it. Unless, therefore, God
          be favorable and merciful unto me for Christ's sake, I shall not be
          able, with all my vows and all my good deeds, to stand before
          him.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">This (of Staupitz's) was not only a
          true, but also a godly and a holy desperation; and this must they
          all confess, both with mouth and heart, who will be saved. For the
          godly trust not to their own righteousness. They look unto Christ
          their reconciler, who gave his life for their sins. Moreover, they
          know that the remnant of sin which is in their flesh is not laid to
          their charge, but freely pardoned. Notwithstanding, in the mean
          while they fight in spirit against the flesh, lest they

<span style="font-size: 90%">the lusts thereof; and although they
          feel the flesh to rage and rebel, and themselves also do fall

        thou seest thyself fallen once and a thousand times, thou oughtest to
        make use of the remedy which I have given thee, that is, a loving
        confidence in the divine mercy. These are the weapons with which thou
        must fight and conquer cowardice and vain thoughts. This is the means
        thou oughtest to use—not to lose time, not to disturb thyself, and
        reap no good.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_68" id="noteref_68" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now in contrast
        with such healthy-minded views as these, if we treat them as a way of
        deliberately minimizing evil, stands a radically opposite view, a way
        of maximizing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg
        131]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg131"/>
        evil, if you please so to call it, based on the persuasion that the
        evil aspects of our life are of its very essence, and that the
        world's meaning most comes home to us when we lay them most to heart.
        We have now to address ourselves to this more morbid way of looking
        at the situation. But as I closed our last hour with a general
        philosophical reflection on the healthy-minded way of taking life, I
        should like at this point to make another philosophical reflection
        upon it before turning to that heavier task. You will excuse the
        brief delay.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we admit that
        evil is an essential part of our being and the key to the
        interpretation of our life, we load ourselves down with a difficulty
        that has always proved burdensome in philosophies of religion.
        Theism, whenever it has erected itself into a systematic philosophy
        of the universe, has shown a reluctance to let God be anything less
        than All-in-All. In other words, philosophic theism has always shown
        a tendency to become pantheistic and monistic, and to consider the
        world as one unit of absolute fact; and this has been at variance
        with popular or practical theism, which latter has ever been more or
        less frankly pluralistic, not to say polytheistic, and shown itself
        perfectly well satisfied with a universe composed of many original
        principles, provided we be only allowed to believe that the divine
        principle remains supreme, and that the others are subordinate. In
        this latter case God is not necessarily responsible for the existence
        of evil; he would only be responsible if it were not finally
        overcome. But on the monistic or pantheistic view, evil, like
        everything else, must have its foundation in God; and the difficulty
        is to see how this can possibly be the case if God be absolutely
        good. This difficulty faces us in every form of philosophy in which
        the world appears as one flawless unit of fact. Such a unit is an
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Individual</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg132"/> and in it the worst parts must be as essential
        as the best, must be as necessary to make the individual what he is;
        since if any part whatever in an individual were to vanish or alter,
        it would no longer be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> individual at all. The
        philosophy of absolute idealism, so vigorously represented both in
        Scotland and America to-day, has to struggle with this difficulty
        quite as much as scholastic theism struggled in its time; and
        although it would be premature to say that there is no speculative
        issue whatever from the puzzle, it is perfectly fair to say that
        there is no clear or easy issue, and that the only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">obvious</span></em>
        escape from paradox here is to cut loose from the monistic assumption
        altogether, and to allow the world to have existed from its origin in
        pluralistic form, as an aggregate or collection of higher and lower
        things and principles, rather than an absolutely unitary fact. For
        then evil would not need to be essential; it might be, and may always
        have been, an independent portion that had no rational or absolute
        right to live with the rest, and which we might conceivably hope to
        see got rid of at last.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now the gospel of
        healthy-mindedness, as we have described it, casts its vote
        distinctly for this pluralistic view. Whereas the monistic
        philosopher finds himself more or less bound to say, as Hegel said,
        that everything actual is rational, and that evil, as an element
        dialectically required, must be pinned in and kept and consecrated
        and have a function awarded to it in the final system of truth,
        healthy-mindedness refuses to say anything of the sort.<a href="#note_69" id="noteref_69" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a> Evil, it
        says, is emphatically irrational, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg133"/> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> to be pinned in, or preserved,
        or consecrated in any final system of truth. It is a pure abomination
        to the Lord, an alien unreality, a waste element, to be sloughed off
        and negated, and the very memory of it, if possible, wiped out and
        forgotten. The ideal, so far from being co-extensive with the whole
        actual, is a mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extract</span></em> from the actual, marked by
        its deliverance from all contact with this diseased, inferior, and
        excrementitious stuff.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here we have the
        interesting notion fairly and squarely presented to us, of there
        being elements of the universe which may make no rational whole in
        conjunction with the other elements, and which, from the point of
        view of any system which those other elements make up, can only be
        considered so much irrelevance and accident—so much <span class="tei tei-q">“dirt,”</span> as it were, and matter out of place. I ask
        you now not to forget this notion; for although most philosophers
        seem either to forget it or to disdain it too much ever to mention
        it, I believe that we shall have to admit it ourselves in the end as
        containing an element of truth. The mind-cure gospel thus once more
        appears to us as having dignity and importance. We have seen it to be
        a genuine religion, and no mere silly appeal to imagination to cure
        disease; we have seen its method of experimental verification to be
        not unlike the method of all science; and now here we find mind-cure
        as the champion of a perfectly definite conception of the
        metaphysical structure of the world. I hope that, in view of all
        this, you will not regret my having pressed it upon your attention at
        such length.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us now say
        good-by for a while to all this way of thinking, and turn towards
        those persons who cannot so swiftly throw off the burden of the
        consciousness of evil, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg
        134]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg134"/> but
        are congenitally fated to suffer from its presence. Just as we saw
        that in healthy-mindedness there are shallower and profounder levels,
        happiness like that of the mere animal, and more regenerate sorts of
        happiness, so also are there different levels of the morbid mind, and
        the one is much more formidable than the other. There are people for
        whom evil means only a mal-adjustment with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">things</span></em>, a
        wrong correspondence of one's life with the environment. Such evil as
        this is curable, in principle at least, upon the natural plane, for
        merely by modifying either the self or the things, or both at once,
        the two terms may be made to fit, and all go merry as a marriage bell
        again. But there are others for whom evil is no mere relation of the
        subject to particular outer things, but something more radical and
        general, a wrongness or vice in his essential nature, which no
        alteration of the environment, or any superficial rearrangement of
        the inner self, can cure, and which requires a supernatural remedy.
        On the whole, the Latin races have leaned more towards the former way
        of looking upon evil, as made up of ills and sins in the plural,
        removable in detail; while the Germanic races have tended rather to
        think of Sin in the singular, and with a capital S, as of something
        ineradicably ingrained in our natural subjectivity, and never to be
        removed by any superficial piecemeal operations.<a href="#note_70" id="noteref_70" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a> These
        comparisons of races are always open to exception, but undoubtedly
        the northern tone in religion has inclined to the more intimately
        pessimistic persuasion, and this way of feeling, being the more
        extreme, we shall find by far the more instructive for our study.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Recent psychology
        has found great use for the word <span class="tei tei-q">“threshold”</span> as a symbolic designation for the
        point at which one state of mind passes into another. Thus we
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg135"/> speak of the threshold of a
        man's consciousness in general, to indicate the amount of noise,
        pressure, or other outer stimulus which it takes to arouse his
        attention at all. One with a high threshold will doze through an
        amount of racket by which one with a low threshold would be
        immediately waked. Similarly, when one is sensitive to small
        differences in any order of sensation, we say he has a low
        <span class="tei tei-q">“difference-threshold”</span>—his mind easily
        steps over it into the consciousness of the differences in question.
        And just so we might speak of a <span class="tei tei-q">“pain-threshold,”</span> a <span class="tei tei-q">“fear-threshold,”</span> a <span class="tei tei-q">“misery-threshold,”</span> and find it quickly overpassed
        by the consciousness of some individuals, but lying too high in
        others to be often reached by their consciousness. The sanguine and
        healthy-minded live habitually on the sunny side of their
        misery-line, the depressed and melancholy live beyond it, in darkness
        and apprehension. There are men who seem to have started in life with
        a bottle or two of champagne inscribed to their credit; whilst others
        seem to have been born close to the pain-threshold, which the
        slightest irritants fatally send them over.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Does it not appear
        as if one who lived more habitually on one side of the pain-threshold
        might need a different sort of religion from one who habitually lived
        on the other? This question, of the relativity of different types of
        religion to different types of need, arises naturally at this point,
        and will become a serious problem ere we have done. But before we
        confront it in general terms, we must address ourselves to the
        unpleasant task of hearing what the sick souls, as we may call them
        in contrast to the healthy-minded, have to say of the secrets of
        their prison-house, their own peculiar form of consciousness. Let us
        then resolutely turn our backs on the once-born and their sky-blue
        optimistic gospel; let us not simply cry <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg136"/> out, in spite of all appearances, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hurrah for the Universe!—God's in his Heaven, all's
        right with the world.”</span> Let us see rather whether pity, pain,
        and fear, and the sentiment of human helplessness may not open a
        profounder view and put into our hands a more complicated key to the
        meaning of the situation.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To begin with, how
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></em> things so insecure as the
        successful experiences of this world afford a stable anchorage? A
        chain is no stronger than its weakest link, and life is after all a
        chain. In the healthiest and most prosperous existence, how many
        links of illness, danger, and disaster are always interposed?
        Unsuspectedly from the bottom of every fountain of pleasure, as the
        old poet said, something bitter rises up: a touch of nausea, a
        falling dead of the delight, a whiff of melancholy, things that sound
        a knell, for fugitive as they may be, they bring a feeling of coming
        from a deeper region and often have an appalling convincingness. The
        buzz of life ceases at their touch as a piano-string stops sounding
        when the damper falls upon it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of course the
        music can commence again;—and again and again,—at intervals. But with
        this the healthy-minded consciousness is left with an irremediable
        sense of precariousness. It is a bell with a crack; it draws its
        breath on sufferance and by an accident.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even if we suppose
        a man so packed with healthy-mindedness as never to have experienced
        in his own person any of these sobering intervals, still, if he is a
        reflecting being, he must generalize and class his own lot with that
        of others; and, doing so, he must see that his escape is just a lucky
        chance and no essential difference. He might just as well have been
        born to an entirely different fortune. And then indeed the hollow
        security! What <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg
        137]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg137"/>
        kind of a frame of things is it of which the best you can say is,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Thank God, it has let me off clear this
        time!”</span> Is not its blessedness a fragile fiction? Is not your
        joy in it a very vulgar glee, not much unlike the snicker of any
        rogue at his success? If indeed it were all success, even on such
        terms as that! But take the happiest man, the one most envied by the
        world, and in nine cases out of ten his inmost consciousness is one
        of failure. Either his ideals in the line of his achievements are
        pitched far higher than the achievements themselves, or else he has
        secret ideals of which the world knows nothing, and in regard to
        which he inwardly knows himself to be found wanting.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Failure, then,
        failure! so the world stamps us at every turn. We strew it with our
        blunders, our misdeeds, our lost opportunities, with all the
        memorials of our inadequacy to our vocation. And with what a damning
        emphasis does it then blot us out! No easy fine, no mere apology or
        formal expiation, will satisfy the world's demands, but every pound
        of flesh exacted is soaked with all its blood. The subtlest forms of
        suffering known to man are connected with the poisonous humiliations
        incidental to these results.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And they are
        pivotal human experiences. A process so ubiquitous and everlasting is
        evidently an integral part of life. <span class="tei tei-q">“There is

        nature being thus rooted in failure, is it any wonder that
        theologians should have held it to be essential, and thought that
        only through the personal experience of humiliation which it
        engenders the deeper sense of life's significance is reached?<a href="#note_72" id="noteref_72" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg139"/>

        themselves when they occur is spoiled and vitiated. All natural goods
        perish. Riches take wings; fame is a breath; love is a cheat; youth
        and health and pleasure vanish. Can things whose end is always dust

        its negation are beaten up inextricably together. But if the life be
        good, the negation of it must be bad. Yet the two are equally
        essential facts of existence; and all natural happiness thus seems
        infected with a contradiction. The breath of the sepulchre surrounds
        it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To a mind
        attentive to this state of things and rightly subject to the

        animal talk as that be treated as a rational answer? To ascribe
        religious value to mere happy-go-lucky contentment with one's brief
        chance at natural good is but the very consecration of forgetfulness
        and superficiality. Our troubles lie indeed too deep for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>
        cure. The fact that we <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></em> die, that we <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></em> be
        ill at all, is what perplexes us; the fact that we now for a moment
        live and are well is irrelevant to that perplexity. We need a life
        not correlated with death, a health not liable to illness, a kind of
        good that will not perish, a good in fact that flies beyond the Goods
        of nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It all depends on
        how sensitive the soul may become to discords. <span class="tei tei-q">“The trouble with me is that I believe too much in common
        happiness and goodness,”</span> said a friend of mine whose
        consciousness was of this sort, <span class="tei tei-q">“and nothing
        can console me for their transiency. I am appalled and disconcerted
        at its being possible.”</span> And so with most of us: a little
        cooling down of animal excitability and instinct, a little loss of
        animal toughness, a little irritable weakness and descent of the
        pain-threshold, will bring the worm at the core of all our usual
        springs of delight into full view, and turn us into melancholy
        metaphysicians. The pride of life and glory of the world will
        shrivel. It is after all but the standing quarrel of hot youth and
        hoary eld. Old age has the last word: the purely naturalistic look at
        life, however enthusiastically it may begin, is sure to end in
        sadness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This sadness lies
        at the heart of every merely positivistic, agnostic, or naturalistic
        scheme of philosophy. Let sanguine healthy-mindedness do its best
        with its strange power of living in the moment and ignoring and
        forgetting, still the evil background is really there to be
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg141"/> thought of, and the skull will
        grin in at the banquet. In the practical life of the individual, we
        know how his whole gloom or glee about any present fact depends on
        the remoter schemes and hopes with which it stands related. Its
        significance and framing give it the chief part of its value. Let it
        be known to lead nowhere, and however agreeable it may be in its
        immediacy, its glow and gilding vanish. The old man, sick with an
        insidious internal disease, may laugh and quaff his wine at first as
        well as ever, but he knows his fate now, for the doctors have
        revealed it; and the knowledge knocks the satisfaction out of all
        these functions. They are partners of death and the worm is their
        brother, and they turn to a mere flatness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lustre of the
        present hour is always borrowed from the background of possibilities
        it goes with. Let our common experiences be enveloped in an eternal
        moral order; let our suffering have an immortal significance; let
        Heaven smile upon the earth, and deities pay their visits; let faith
        and hope be the atmosphere which man breathes in;—and his days pass
        by with zest; they stir with prospects, they thrill with remoter
        values. Place round them on the contrary the curdling cold and gloom
        and absence of all permanent meaning which for pure naturalism and
        the popular science evolutionism of our time are all that is visible
        ultimately, and the thrill stops short, or turns rather to an anxious
        trembling.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For naturalism,
        fed on recent cosmological speculations, mankind is in a position
        similar to that of a set of people living on a frozen lake,
        surrounded by cliffs over which there is no escape, yet knowing that
        little by little the ice is melting, and the inevitable day drawing
        near when the last film of it will disappear, and to be drowned
        ignominiously will be the human creature's portion. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg142"/> merrier the skating, the warmer and more
        sparkling the sun by day, and the ruddier the bonfires at night, the
        more poignant the sadness with which one must take in the meaning of
        the total situation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The early Greeks
        are continually held up to us in literary works as models of the
        healthy-minded joyousness which the religion of nature may engender.
        There was indeed much joyousness among the Greeks—Homer's flow of
        enthusiasm for most things that the sun shines upon is steady. But
        even in Homer the reflective passages are cheerless,<a href="#note_73" id="noteref_73" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a> and the
        moment the Greeks grew systematically pensive and thought of
        ultimates, they became unmitigated pessimists.<a href="#note_74" id="noteref_74" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a> The
        jealousy of the gods, the nemesis that follows too much happiness,
        the all-encompassing death, fate's dark opacity, the ultimate and
        unintelligible cruelty, were the fixed background of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg143"/> their imagination. The beautiful
        joyousness of their polytheism is only a poetic modern fiction. They
        knew no joys comparable in quality of preciousness to those which we
        shall erelong see that Brahmans, Buddhists, Christians, Mohammedans,
        twice-born people whose religion is non-naturalistic, get from their
        several creeds of mysticism and renunciation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Stoic
        insensibility and Epicurean resignation were the farthest advance
        which the Greek mind made in that direction. The Epicurean said:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Seek not to be happy, but rather to escape
        unhappiness; strong happiness is always linked with pain; therefore
        hug the safe shore, and do not tempt the deeper raptures. Avoid
        disappointment by expecting little, and by aiming low; and above all
        do not fret.”</span> The Stoic said: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
        only genuine good that life can yield a man is the free possession of
        his own soul; all other goods are lies.”</span> Each of these
        philosophies is in its degree a philosophy of despair in nature's
        boons. Trustful self-abandonment to the joys that freely offer has
        entirely departed from both Epicurean and Stoic; and what each
        proposes is a way of rescue from the resultant dust-and-ashes state
        of mind. The Epicurean still awaits results from economy of
        indulgence and damping of desire. The Stoic hopes for no results, and
        gives up natural good altogether. There is dignity in both these
        forms of resignation. They represent distinct stages in the sobering
        process which man's primitive intoxication with sense-happiness is
        sure to undergo. In the one the hot blood has grown cool, in the
        other it has become quite cold; and although I have spoken of them in
        the past tense, as if they were merely historic, yet Stoicism and
        Epicureanism will probably be to all time typical attitudes, marking
        a certain definite stage accomplished in the evolution of the
        world-sick <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg
        144]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg144"/>
        soul.<a href="#note_75" id="noteref_75" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a> They
        mark the conclusion of what we call the once-born period, and
        represent the highest flights of what twice-born religion would call
        the purely natural man—Epicureanism, which can only by great courtesy
        be called a religion, showing his refinement, and Stoicism exhibiting
        his moral will. They leave the world in the shape of an unreconciled
        contradiction, and seek no higher unity. Compared with the complex
        ecstasies which the supernaturally regenerated Christian may enjoy,
        or the oriental pantheist indulge in, their receipts for equanimity
        are expedients which seem almost crude in their simplicity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please observe,
        however, that I am not yet pretending finally to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">judge</span></em> any
        of these attitudes. I am only describing their variety.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The securest way
        to the rapturous sorts of happiness of which the twice-born make
        report has as an historic matter of fact been through a more radical
        pessimism than anything that we have yet considered. We have seen how
        the lustre and enchantment may be rubbed off from the goods of
        nature. But there is a pitch of unhappiness so great that the goods
        of nature may be entirely forgotten, and all sentiment of their
        existence vanish from the mental field. For this extremity of
        pessimism to be reached, something more is needed than observation of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg145"/> life and reflection upon
        death. The individual must in his own person become the prey of a
        pathological melancholy. As the healthy-minded enthusiast succeeds in
        ignoring evil's very existence, so the subject of melancholy is
        forced in spite of himself to ignore that of all good whatever: for
        him it may no longer have the least reality. Such sensitiveness and
        susceptibility to mental pain is a rare occurrence where the nervous
        constitution is entirely normal; one seldom finds it in a healthy
        subject even where he is the victim of the most atrocious cruelties
        of outward fortune. So we note here the neurotic constitution, of
        which I said so much in my first lecture, making its active entrance
        on our scene, and destined to play a part in much that follows. Since
        these experiences of melancholy are in the first instance absolutely
        private and individual, I can now help myself out with personal
        documents. Painful indeed they will be to listen to, and there is
        almost an indecency in handling them in public. Yet they lie right in
        the middle of our path; and if we are to touch the psychology of
        religion at all seriously, we must be willing to forget
        conventionalities, and dive below the smooth and lying official
        conversational surface.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One can
        distinguish many kinds of pathological depression. Sometimes it is
        mere passive joylessness and dreariness, discouragement, dejection,
        lack of taste and zest and spring. Professor Ribot has proposed the
        name <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anhedonia</span></em> to designate this
        condition.</p>

          The same things which formerly convulsed her with laughter entirely
          failed to interest her now. Esquirol observed the case of a very

          Every emotion appeared dead within him. He manifested neither
          perversion nor violence, but complete absence of emotional
          reaction. If he went to the theatre, which he did out of habit, he
          could find no pleasure there. The thought of his house, of his
          home, of his wife, and of his absent children moved him as little,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Prolonged
        seasickness will in most persons produce a temporary condition of
        anhedonia. Every good, terrestrial or celestial, is imagined only to
        be turned from with disgust. A temporary condition of this sort,
        connected with the religious evolution of a singularly lofty
        character, both intellectual and moral, is well described by the
        Catholic philosopher, Father Gratry, in his autobiographical
        recollections. In consequence of mental isolation and excessive study
        at the Polytechnic school, young Gratry fell into a state of nervous
        exhaustion with symptoms which he thus describes:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em">

        with a start, thinking that the Pantheon was tumbling on the
        Polytechnic school, or that the school was in flames, or that the
        Seine was pouring into the Catacombs, and that Paris was being
        swallowed up. And when these impressions were past, all day long
        without respite I suffered an incurable and intolerable desolation,
        verging on despair. I thought myself, in fact, rejected by God, lost,
        damned! I felt something like the suffering of hell. Before that I
        had never even thought of hell. My mind had never turned in that
        direction. Neither discourses nor reflections had impressed me in
        that way. I took no account of hell. Now, and all at once, I suffered
        in a measure what is suffered there.</span></span></p>

          Happiness, joy, light, affection, love—all these words were now
          devoid of sense. Without doubt I could still have talked of all
          these things, but I had become incapable of feeling anything in
          them, of understanding anything about them, of hoping anything from
          them, or of believing them to exist. There was my great and
          inconsolable grief! I neither perceived nor conceived any longer

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So much for
        melancholy in the sense of incapacity for joyous feeling. A much
        worse form of it is positive and active anguish, a sort of psychical
        neuralgia wholly unknown to healthy life. Such anguish may partake of
        various characters, having sometimes more the quality of loathing;
        sometimes that of irritation and exasperation; or again of
        self-mistrust and self-despair; or of suspicion, anxiety,
        trepidation, fear. The patient may rebel or submit; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg148"/> may accuse himself, or accuse outside
        powers; and he may or he may not be tormented by the theoretical
        mystery of why he should so have to suffer. Most cases are mixed
        cases, and we should not treat our classifications with too much
        respect. Moreover, it is only a relatively small proportion of cases
        that connect themselves with the religious sphere of experience at
        all. Exasperated cases, for instance, as a rule do not. I quote now
        literally from the first case of melancholy on which I lay my hand.

        dreadful visions, lightning, thunder, and the rest), fear, atrocious
        fear, presses me down, holds me without respite, never lets me go.
        Where is the justice in it all! What have I done to deserve this
        excess of severity? Under what form will this fear crush me? What

        two things. First, you see how the entire consciousness of the poor
        man is so choked with the feeling of evil that the sense of there
        being any good in the world is lost for him altogether. His attention
        excludes it, cannot admit it: the sun has left his heaven. And
        secondly you see how the querulous temper of his misery keeps his
        mind from taking a religious direction. Querulousness of mind tends
        in fact rather towards irreligion; and it has played, so far as I
        know, no part whatever in the construction of religious systems.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Religious
        melancholy must be cast in a more melting mood. Tolstoy has left us,
        in his book called My Confession, a wonderful account of the attack
        of melancholy which led him to his own religious conclusions. The
        latter in some respects are peculiar; but the melancholy presents two
        characters which make it a typical document for our present purpose.
        First it is a well-marked case of anhedonia, of passive loss of
        appetite for all life's values; and second, it shows how the altered
        and estranged aspect which the world assumed in consequence of this
        stimulated Tolstoy's intellect to a gnawing, carking questioning and
        effort for philosophic relief. I mean <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg150"/> to quote Tolstoy at some length; but before
        doing so, I will make a general remark on each of these two
        points.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First on our
        spiritual judgments and the sense of value in general.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is notorious
        that facts are compatible with opposite emotional comments, since the
        same fact will inspire entirely different feelings in different
        persons, and at different times in the same person; and there is no
        rationally deducible connection between any outer fact and the
        sentiments it may happen to provoke. These have their source in
        another sphere of existence altogether, in the animal and spiritual
        region of the subject's being. Conceive yourself, if possible,
        suddenly stripped of all the emotion with which your world now
        inspires you, and try to imagine it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as it
        exists</span></em>, purely by itself, without your favorable or
        unfavorable, hopeful or apprehensive comment. It will be almost
        impossible for you to realize such a condition of negativity and
        deadness. No one portion of the universe would then have importance
        beyond another; and the whole collection of its things and series of
        its events would be without significance, character, expression, or
        perspective. Whatever of value, interest, or meaning our respective
        worlds may appear endued with are thus pure gifts of the spectator's
        mind. The passion of love is the most familiar and extreme example of
        this fact. If it comes, it comes; if it does not come, no process of
        reasoning can force it. Yet it transforms the value of the creature
        loved as utterly as the sunrise transforms Mont Blanc from a
        corpse-like gray to a rosy enchantment; and it sets the whole world
        to a new tune for the lover and gives a new issue to his life. So
        with fear, with indignation, jealousy, ambition, worship. If they are
        there, life changes. And whether they shall be there or not depends
        almost always upon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg
        151]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg151"/>
        non-logical, often on organic conditions. And as the excited interest
        which these passions put into the world is our gift to the world,
        just so are the passions themselves <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gifts</span></em>,—gifts to us, from sources
        sometimes low and sometimes high; but almost always non-logical and
        beyond our control. How can the moribund old man reason back to
        himself the romance, the mystery, the imminence of great things with
        which our old earth tingled for him in the days when he was young and
        well? Gifts, either of the flesh or of the spirit; and the spirit
        bloweth where it listeth; and the world's materials lend their
        surface passively to all the gifts alike, as the stage-setting
        receives indifferently whatever alternating colored lights may be
        shed upon it from the optical apparatus in the gallery.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the
        practically real world for each one of us, the effective world of the
        individual, is the compound world, the physical facts and emotional
        values in indistinguishable combination. Withdraw or pervert either
        factor of this complex resultant, and the kind of experience we call
        pathological ensues.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Tolstoy's case
        the sense that life had any meaning whatever was for a time wholly
        withdrawn. The result was a transformation in the whole expression of
        reality. When we come to study the phenomenon of conversion or
        religious regeneration, we shall see that a not infrequent
        consequence of the change operated in the subject is a
        transfiguration of the face of nature in his eyes. A new heaven seems
        to shine upon a new earth. In melancholiacs there is usually a
        similar change, only it is in the reverse direction. The world now
        looks remote, strange, sinister, uncanny. Its color is gone, its
        breath is cold, there is no speculation in the eyes it glares with.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“It is as if I lived in another

        why? Everything floats before my eyes, but leaves no
        impression.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“I weep false tears, I
        have unreal hands: the things I see are not real things.”</span>—Such
        are expressions that naturally rise to the lips of melancholy
        subjects describing their changed state.<a href="#note_79" id="noteref_79" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now there are some
        subjects whom all this leaves a prey to the profoundest astonishment.
        The strangeness is wrong. The unreality cannot be. A mystery is
        concealed, and a metaphysical solution must exist. If the natural
        world is so double-faced and unhomelike, what world, what thing is
        real? An urgent wondering and questioning is set up, a poring
        theoretic activity, and in the desperate effort to get into right
        relations with the matter, the sufferer is often led to what becomes
        for him a satisfying religious solution.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At about the age
        of fifty, Tolstoy relates that he began to have moments of
        perplexity, of what he calls arrest, as if he knew not <span class="tei tei-q">“how to live,”</span> or what to do. It is obvious that
        these were moments in which the excitement and interest which our
        functions naturally bring had ceased. Life had been enchanting, it
        was now flat sober, more than sober, dead. Things were meaningless
        whose <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg153"/> meaning had always
        been self-evident. The questions <span class="tei tei-q">“Why?”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“What
        next?”</span> began to beset him more and more frequently. At first
        it seemed as if such questions must be answerable, and as if he could
        easily find the answers if he would take the time; but as they ever
        became more urgent, he perceived that it was like those first
        discomforts of a sick man, to which he pays but little attention till
        they run into one continuous suffering, and then he realizes that
        what he took for a passing disorder means the most momentous thing in
        the world for him, means his death.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These questions
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Why?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Wherefore?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“What
        for?”</span> found no response.</p>

          or another. It cannot be said exactly that I</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">wished</span></em>
<span style="font-size: 90%">to kill myself, for the force which

          a large property which was increasing with no pains taken on my
          part. I was more respected by my kinsfolk and</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg154"/><span style="font-size: 90%">acquaintance than I had ever been; I was loaded
          with praise by strangers; and without exaggeration I could believe
          my name already famous. Moreover I was neither insane nor ill. On
          the contrary, I possessed a physical and mental strength which I
          have rarely met in persons of my age. I could mow as well as the
          peasants, I could work with my brain eight hours uninterruptedly
          and feel no bad effects.</span></span></p>

          this from the very beginning. My state of mind was as if some
          wicked and stupid jest was being played upon me by some one. One
          can live only so long as one is intoxicated, drunk with life; but
          when one grows sober one cannot fail to see that it is all a stupid
          cheat. What is truest about it is that there is nothing even funny

          should be the prey of the beast, not daring to jump to the bottom
          lest he should be devoured by the dragon, clings to the branches of
          a wild bush which grows out of one of the cracks of the well. His
          hands weaken, and he feels that he must soon give way to certain
          fate; but still he clings, and sees two mice, one white, the other

          himself,—and I found nothing. I became convinced, moreover, that
          all those who before me had sought for an answer in the sciences
          have also found nothing. And not only this, but that they have

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To prove this
        point, Tolstoy quotes the Buddha, Solomon, and Schopenhauer. And he
        finds only four ways in which men of his own class and society are
        accustomed to meet the situation. Either mere animal blindness,
        sucking the honey without seeing the dragon or the mice,—<span class="tei tei-q">“and from such a way,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I can learn nothing, after what I now know;”</span> or
        reflective epicureanism, snatching what it can while the day
        lasts,—which is only a more deliberate sort of stupefaction than the
        first; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg156"/> or manly suicide; or
        seeing the mice and dragon and yet weakly and plaintively clinging to

          draw me out of my situation of despair.... During the whole course
          of this year, when I almost unceasingly kept asking myself how to
          end the business, whether by the rope or by the bullet, during all
          that time, alongside of all those movements of my ideas and
          observations, my heart kept languishing with another pining
          emotion. I can call this by no other name than that of a thirst for
          God. This craving for God had nothing to do with the movement of my
          ideas,—in fact, it was the direct contrary of that movement,—but it
          came from my heart. It was like a feeling of dread that made me
          seem like an orphan and isolated in the midst of all these things
          that were so foreign. And this feeling of dread was mitigated by
          the hope of finding the assistance of some one.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_80" id="noteref_80" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the process,
        intellectual as well as emotional, which, starting from this idea of
        God, led to Tolstoy's recovery, I will say nothing in this lecture,
        reserving it for a later hour. The only thing that need interest us
        now is the phenomenon of his absolute disenchantment with ordinary
        life, and the fact that the whole range of habitual values may, to a
        man as powerful and full of faculty as he was, come to appear so
        ghastly a mockery.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When
        disillusionment has gone as far as this, there is seldom a

        tasted of the fruit of the tree, and the happiness of Eden never

        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg157"/> often enough it fails to
        return in an acute form, though its form is sometimes very acute,—is
        not the simple ignorance of ill, but something vastly more complex,
        including natural evil as one of its elements, but finding natural
        evil no such stumbling-block and terror because it now sees it
        swallowed up in supernatural good. The process is one of redemption,
        not of mere reversion to natural health, and the sufferer, when
        saved, is saved by what seems to him a second birth, a deeper kind of
        conscious being than he could enjoy before.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We find a somewhat
        different type of religious melancholy enshrined in literature in
        John Bunyan's autobiography. Tolstoy's preoccupations were largely
        objective, for the purpose and meaning of life in general was what so
        troubled him; but poor Bunyan's troubles were over the condition of
        his own personal self. He was a typical case of the psychopathic
        temperament, sensitive of conscience to a diseased degree, beset by
        doubts, fears, and insistent ideas, and a victim of verbal
        automatisms, both motor and sensory. These were usually texts of
        Scripture which, sometimes damnatory and sometimes favorable, would
        come in a half-hallucinatory form as if they were voices, and fasten
        on his mind and buffet it between them like a shuttlecock. Added to
        this were a fearful melancholy self-contempt and despair.</p>

          could equal me for inward wickedness and pollution of mind. Sure,

        general depression of spirits about my prospects, I went one evening
        into a dressing-room in the twilight to procure some article that was
        there; when suddenly there fell upon me without any warning, just as
        if it came out of the darkness, a horrible fear of my own existence.
        Simultaneously there arose in my mind the image of an epileptic
        patient whom I had seen in the asylum, a black-haired youth with
        greenish skin, entirely idiotic, who used to sit all day on one of
        the benches, or rather shelves against the wall, with his knees drawn
        up against his chin, and the coarse gray undershirt, which was his
        only garment, drawn over them inclosing his entire figure. He sat
        there like a sort of sculptured Egyptian cat or Peruvian mummy,
        moving nothing but his black eyes and looking absolutely non-human.
        This image and my fear entered into a species of combination with

        horror of him, and such a perception of my own merely momentary
        discrepancy from him, that it was as if something hitherto solid
        within my breast gave way entirely, and I became a mass of quivering
        fear. After this the universe was changed for me altogether. I awoke
        morning after morning with a horrible dread at the pit of my stomach,
        and with a sense of the insecurity of life that I never knew before,
        and that I have never felt since.</span><a href="#note_83" id="noteref_83" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a>

        of more examples. The cases we have looked at are enough. One of them
        gives us the vanity of mortal things; another the sense of sin; and
        the remaining one describes the fear of the universe;—and in one or
        other of these three ways it always is that man's original optimism
        and self-satisfaction get leveled with the dust.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In none of these
        cases was there any intellectual insanity <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg162"/> or delusion about matters of fact; but were we
        disposed to open the chapter of really insane melancholia, with its
        hallucinations and delusions, it would be a worse story
        still—desperation absolute and complete, the whole universe
        coagulating about the sufferer into a material of overwhelming
        horror, surrounding him without opening or end. Not the conception or
        intellectual perception of evil, but the grisly blood-freezing
        heart-palsying sensation of it close upon one, and no other
        conception or sensation able to live for a moment in its presence.
        How irrelevantly remote seem all our usual refined optimisms and
        intellectual and moral consolations in presence of a need of help
        like this! Here is the real core of the religious problem: Help!
        help! No prophet can claim to bring a final message unless he says
        things that will have a sound of reality in the ears of victims such
        as these. But the deliverance must come in as strong a form as the
        complaint, if it is to take effect; and that seems a reason why the
        coarser religions, revivalistic, orgiastic, with blood and miracles
        and supernatural operations, may possibly never be displaced. Some
        constitutions need them too much.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Arrived at this
        point, we can see how great an antagonism may naturally arise between
        the healthy-minded way of viewing life and the way that takes all
        this experience of evil as something essential. To this latter way,
        the morbid-minded way, as we might call it, healthy-mindedness pure
        and simple seems unspeakably blind and shallow. To the healthy-minded
        way, on the other hand, the way of the sick soul seems unmanly and
        diseased. With their grubbing in rat-holes instead of living in the
        light; with their manufacture of fears, and preoccupation with every
        unwholesome kind of misery, there is something <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg163"/> almost obscene about these children of
        wrath and cravers of a second birth. If religious intolerance and
        hanging and burning could again become the order of the day, there is
        little doubt that, however it may have been in the past, the
        healthy-minded would at present show themselves the less indulgent
        party of the two.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In our own
        attitude, not yet abandoned, of impartial onlookers, what are we to
        say of this quarrel? It seems to me that we are bound to say that
        morbid-mindedness ranges over the wider scale of experience, and that
        its survey is the one that overlaps. The method of averting one's
        attention from evil, and living simply in the light of good is
        splendid as long as it will work. It will work with many persons; it
        will work far more generally than most of us are ready to suppose;
        and within the sphere of its successful operation there is nothing to
        be said against it as a religious solution. But it breaks down
        impotently as soon as melancholy comes; and even though one be quite
        free from melancholy one's self, there is no doubt that
        healthy-mindedness is inadequate as a philosophical doctrine, because
        the evil facts which it refuses positively to account for are a
        genuine portion of reality; and they may after all be the best key to
        life's significance, and possibly the only openers of our eyes to the
        deepest levels of truth.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The normal process
        of life contains moments as bad as any of those which insane
        melancholy is filled with, moments in which radical evil gets its
        innings and takes its solid turn. The lunatic's visions of horror are
        all drawn from the material of daily fact. Our civilization is
        founded on the shambles, and every individual existence goes out in a
        lonely spasm of helpless agony. If you protest, my friend, wait till
        you arrive there yourself! To believe in the carnivorous reptiles of
        geologic <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg
        164]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg164"/>
        times is hard for our imagination—they seem too much like mere museum
        specimens. Yet there is no tooth in any one of those museum-skulls
        that did not daily through long years of the foretime hold fast to
        the body struggling in despair of some fated living victim. Forms of
        horror just as dreadful to their victims, if on a smaller spatial
        scale, fill the world about us to-day. Here on our very hearths and
        in our gardens the infernal cat plays with the panting mouse, or
        holds the hot bird fluttering in her jaws. Crocodiles and
        rattlesnakes and pythons are at this moment vessels of life as real
        as we are; their loathsome existence fills every minute of every day
        that drags its length along; and whenever they or other wild beasts
        clutch their living prey, the deadly horror which an agitated
        melancholiac feels is the literally right reaction on the
        situation.<a href="#note_85" id="noteref_85" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may indeed be
        that no religious reconciliation with the absolute totality of things
        is possible. Some evils, indeed, are ministerial to higher forms of
        good; but it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg
        165]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg165"/> may
        be that there are forms of evil so extreme as to enter into no good
        system whatsoever, and that, in respect of such evil, dumb submission
        or neglect to notice is the only practical resource. This question
        must confront us on a later day. But provisionally, and as a mere
        matter of program and method, since the evil facts are as genuine
        parts of nature as the good ones, the philosophic presumption should
        be that they have some rational significance, and that systematic
        healthy-mindedness, failing as it does to accord to sorrow, pain, and
        death any positive and active attention whatever, is formally less
        complete than systems that try at least to include these elements in
        their scope.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The completest
        religions would therefore seem to be those in which the pessimistic
        elements are best developed. Buddhism, of course, and Christianity
        are the best known to us of these. They are essentially religions of
        deliverance: the man must die to an unreal life before he can be born
        into the real life. In my next lecture, I will try to discuss some of
        the psychological conditions of this second birth. Fortunately from
        now onward we shall have to deal with more cheerful subjects than
        those which we have recently been dwelling on.</p>

<span style="font-size: 173%">Lecture VIII. The Divided Self, And The
        Process Of Its Unification.</span></h1>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last lecture
        was a painful one, dealing as it did with evil as a pervasive element
        of the world we live in. At the close of it we were brought into full
        view of the contrast between the two ways of looking at life which
        are characteristic respectively of what we called the healthy-minded,
        who need to be born only once, and of the sick souls, who must be
        twice-born in order to be happy. The result is two different
        conceptions of the universe of our experience. In the religion of the
        once-born the world is a sort of rectilinear or one-storied affair,
        whose accounts are kept in one denomination, whose parts have just
        the values which naturally they appear to have, and of which a simple
        algebraic sum of pluses and minuses will give the total worth.
        Happiness and religious peace consist in living on the plus side of
        the account. In the religion of the twice-born, on the other hand,
        the world is a double-storied mystery. Peace cannot be reached by the
        simple addition of pluses and elimination of minuses from life.
        Natural good is not simply insufficient in amount and transient,
        there lurks a falsity in its very being. Cancelled as it all is by
        death if not by earlier enemies, it gives no final balance, and can
        never be the thing intended for our lasting worship. It keeps us from
        our real good, rather; and renunciation and despair of it are our
        first step in the direction of the truth. There are two lives, the
        natural <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg167"/> and the spiritual, and
        we must lose the one before we can participate in the other.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In their extreme
        forms, of pure naturalism and pure salvationism, the two types are
        violently contrasted; though here as in most other current
        classifications, the radical extremes are somewhat ideal
        abstractions, and the concrete human beings whom we oftenest meet are
        intermediate varieties and mixtures. Practically, however, you all
        recognize the difference: you understand, for example, the disdain of
        the methodist convert for the mere sky-blue healthy-minded moralist;
        and you likewise enter into the aversion of the latter to what seems
        to him the diseased subjectivism of the Methodist, dying to live, as
        he calls it, and making of paradox and the inversion of natural
        appearances the essence of God's truth.<a href="#note_86" id="noteref_86" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Recent works on
        the psychology of character have had much to say upon this
        point.<a href="#note_88" id="noteref_88" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a> Some
        persons are born with an inner constitution which is harmonious and
        well balanced from the outset. Their impulses are consistent with one
        another, their will follows without trouble the guidance of their
        intellect, their passions are not excessive, and their lives are
        little haunted by regrets. Others are oppositely constituted; and are
        so in degrees which may vary from something so slight as to result in
        a merely odd or whimsical inconsistency, to a discordancy of which
        the consequences may be inconvenient in the extreme. Of the more
        innocent kinds of heterogeneity I find a good example in Mrs. Annie
        Besant's autobiography.</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I have ever been the queerest mixture of weakness
        and strength, and have paid heavily for the weakness. As a child I
        used to suffer tortures of shyness, and if my shoe-lace was untied
        would feel shamefacedly that every eye was fixed on the unlucky
        string; as a girl I would shrink away from strangers and think myself
        unwanted and unliked, so that I was full of eager gratitude to any
        one who noticed me kindly; as the young mistress of a house I was
        afraid of my servants, and would let careless work pass rather than
        bear the pain of reproving the ill-doer; when I have been lecturing
        and debating with no lack of spirit on the platform, I have preferred
        to go without what I wanted at the hotel rather than to ring and make
        the waiter fetch it. Combative on the platform in defense of any
        cause I cared for, I shrink from quarrel or disapproval in the house,
        and am a coward at heart in private while a good</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg169"/><span style="font-size: 90%">fighter in public. How often have I passed unhappy
          quarters of an hour screwing up my courage to find fault with some
          subordinate whom my duty compelled me to reprove, and how often
          have I jeered at myself for a fraud as the doughty platform
          combatant, when shrinking from blaming some lad or lass for doing
          their work badly. An unkind look or word has availed to make me
          shrink into myself as a snail into its shell, while, on the
          platform, opposition makes me speak my best.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_89" id="noteref_89" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This amount of
        inconsistency will only count as amiable weakness; but a stronger
        degree of heterogeneity may make havoc of the subject's life. There
        are persons whose existence is little more than a series of zigzags,
        as now one tendency and now another gets the upper hand. Their spirit
        wars with their flesh, they wish for incompatibles, wayward impulses
        interrupt their most deliberate plans, and their lives are one long
        drama of repentance and of effort to repair misdemeanors and
        mistakes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Heterogeneous
        personality has been explained as the result of inheritance—the
        traits of character of incompatible and antagonistic ancestors are
        supposed to be preserved alongside of each other.<a href="#note_90" id="noteref_90" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a> This
        explanation may pass for what it is worth—it certainly needs
        corroboration. But whatever the cause of heterogeneous personality
        may be, we find the extreme examples of it in the psychopathic
        temperament, of which I spoke in my first lecture. All writers about
        that temperament make the inner heterogeneity prominent in their
        descriptions. Frequently, indeed, it is only this trait that leads us
        to ascribe that temperament to a man at all. A <span class="tei tei-q">“dégénéré supérieur”</span> is simply a man of
        sensibility in many directions, who finds more difficulty than is
        common in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg
        170]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg170"/>
        keeping his spiritual house in order and running his furrow straight,
        because his feelings and impulses are too keen and too discrepant
        mutually. In the haunting and insistent ideas, in the irrational
        impulses, the morbid scruples, dreads, and inhibitions which beset
        the psychopathic temperament when it is thoroughly pronounced, we
        have exquisite examples of heterogeneous personality. Bunyan had an
        obsession of the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sell Christ for
        this, sell him for that, sell him, sell him!”</span> which would run
        through his mind a hundred times together, until one day out of
        breath with retorting, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will not, I will
        not,”</span> he impulsively said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let him go
        if he will,”</span> and this loss of the battle kept him in despair
        for over a year. The lives of the saints are full of such blasphemous
        obsessions, ascribed invariably to the direct agency of Satan. The
        phenomenon connects itself with the life of the subconscious self,
        so-called, of which we must ere-long speak more directly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now in all of us,
        however constituted, but to a degree the greater in proportion as we
        are intense and sensitive and subject to diversified temptations, and
        to the greatest possible degree if we are decidedly psychopathic,
        does the normal evolution of character chiefly consist in the
        straightening out and unifying of the inner self. The higher and the
        lower feelings, the useful and the erring impulses, begin by being a
        comparative chaos within us—they must end by forming a stable system
        of functions in right subordination. Unhappiness is apt to
        characterize the period of order-making and struggle. If the
        individual be of tender conscience and religiously quickened, the
        unhappiness will take the form of moral remorse and compunction, of
        feeling inwardly vile and wrong, and of standing in false relations
        to the author of one's being and appointer of one's spiritual fate.
        This is the religious <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg
        171]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg171"/>
        melancholy and <span class="tei tei-q">“conviction of sin”</span>
        that have played so large a part in the history of Protestant
        Christianity. The man's interior is a battle-ground for what he feels
        to be two deadly hostile selves, one actual, the other ideal. As
        Victor Hugo makes his Mahomet say:—</p>

        some typical cases of discordant personality, with melancholy in the
        form of self-condemnation and sense of sin. Saint Augustine's case is
        a classic example. You all remember his half-pagan, half-Christian
        bringing up at Carthage, his emigration to Rome and Milan, his
        adoption of Manicheism and subsequent skepticism, and his restless
        search for truth and purity of life; and finally how, distracted by
        the struggle between the two souls in his breast, and ashamed of his
        own weakness of will, when so many others whom he knew and knew of
        had thrown off the shackles of sensuality and dedicated themselves to
        chastity and the higher life, he heard a voice in the garden say,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Sume,
        lege</span></span>”</span> (take and read), and opening the Bible at
        random, saw the text, <span class="tei tei-q">“not in chambering and
        wantonness,”</span> etc., which seemed directly sent to his address,
        and laid the inner storm to rest forever.<a href="#note_91" id="noteref_91" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a>
        Augustine's psychological genius has <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg172"/> given an account of the trouble of having a
        divided self which has never been surpassed.</p>

        strong enough to overcome that other will, strengthened by long
        indulgence. So these two wills, one old, one new, one carnal, the
        other spiritual, contended with each other and disturbed my soul. I
        understood by my own experience what I had read,</span>

          Yet it was through myself that habit had attained so fierce a
          mastery over me, because I had willingly come whither I willed not.
          Still bound to earth, I refused, O God, to fight on thy side, as

        of conscience. I now began to be esteemed in young company, who knew
        nothing of my mind all this while, and their esteem began to be a
        snare to my soul, for I soon began to be fond of carnal mirth, though
        I still flattered myself that if I did not get drunk, nor curse, nor
        swear, there would be no sin in frolicking and carnal mirth, and I
        thought God would indulge young people with some (what I called
        simple or civil) recreation. I still kept a round of duties, and
        would not suffer myself to run into any open vices, and so got along
        very well in time of health and prosperity, but when I was distressed
        or threatened by sickness, death, or heavy storms of thunder, my
        religion would not do, and I found there was something wanting, and
        would begin to repent my going so much to frolics, but when the
        distress was over, the devil and my own wicked heart, with the
        solicitations of my associates, and my fondness for young

        reading; but God, not willing I should destroy myself, still followed
        me with his calls, and moved with such power upon my conscience, that
        I could not satisfy myself with my diversions, and in the midst of my
        mirth sometimes would have such a sense of my lost and undone
        condition, that I would wish myself from the company, and after it
        was over, when I went home, would make many promises that I would
        attend no more on these frolics, and would beg forgiveness for hours
        and hours; but when I came to have the temptation again, I would give
        way: no sooner would I hear the music and drink a glass of wine, but
        I would find my mind elevated and soon proceed to any sort of
        merriment or diversion, that I thought was not debauched or openly
        vicious; but when I returned from my carnal mirth I felt as guilty as
        ever, and could sometimes not close my eyes for some hours after I
        had gone to my bed. I was one of the most unhappy creatures on

          give me up to hardness of heart. Oh, what unhappy hours and nights
          I thus wore away! When I met sometimes with merry companions, and
          my heart was ready to sink, I would labor to put on as cheerful a
          countenance as possible, that they might not distrust anything, and
          sometimes would begin some discourse with young men or young women
          on purpose, or propose a merry song, lest the distress of my soul

          then rather have been in a wilderness in exile, than with them or
          any of their pleasures or enjoyments. Thus for many months when I
          was in company, I would act the hypocrite and feign a merry heart,

          turn there, to keep my credit up, and retain the esteem of my
          associates: and all this while I continued as strict as possible in
          my duties, and left no stone unturned to pacify my conscience,
          watching even against my thoughts, and praying continually wherever
          I went: for I did not think there was any sin in my conduct, when I

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saint Augustine
        and Alline both emerged into the smooth waters of inner unity and
        peace, and I shall next ask you to consider more closely some of the
        peculiarities of the process of unification, when it occurs. It may
        come gradually, or it may occur abruptly; it may come through altered
        feelings, or through altered powers of action; or it may come through
        new intellectual insights, or through experiences which we shall
        later have to designate as <span class="tei tei-q">“mystical.”</span>
        However it come, it brings a characteristic sort of relief; and never
        such extreme relief as when it is cast into the religious mould.
        Happiness! happiness! religion is only one of the ways in which men
        gain that gift. Easily, permanently, and successfully, it often
        transforms the most intolerable misery into the profoundest and most
        enduring happiness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But to find
        religion is only one out of many ways of reaching unity; and the
        process of remedying inner incompleteness and reducing inner discord
        is a general psychological process, which may take place with any
        sort of mental material, and need not necessarily assume the
        religious form. In judging of the religious types of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg176"/> regeneration which we are about to study,
        it is important to recognize that they are only one species of a
        genus that contains other types as well. For example, the new birth
        may be away from religion into incredulity; or it may be from moral
        scrupulosity into freedom and license; or it may be produced by the
        irruption into the individual's life of some new stimulus or passion,
        such as love, ambition, cupidity, revenge, or patriotic devotion. In
        all these instances we have precisely the same psychological form of
        event,—a firmness, stability, and equilibrium succeeding a period of
        storm and stress and inconsistency. In these non-religious cases the
        new man may also be born either gradually or suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The French
        philosopher Jouffroy has left an eloquent memorial of his own
        <span class="tei tei-q">“counter-conversion,”</span> as the
        transition from orthodoxy to infidelity has been well styled by Mr.
        Starbuck. Jouffroy's doubts had long harassed him; but he dates his
        final crisis from a certain night when his disbelief grew fixed and
        stable, and where the immediate result was sadness at the illusions
        he had lost.</p>

        profligate revels with a number of worthless associates who called
        themselves his friends, and who, when his last means were exhausted,
        treated him of course with neglect or contempt. Reduced to absolute
        want, he one day went out of the house with an intention to put an
        end to his life; but wandering awhile almost unconsciously, he came
        to the brow of an eminence which overlooked what were lately his
        estates. Here he sat down, and remained fixed in thought a number of
        hours, at the end of which he sprang from the ground with a vehement,
        exulting emotion. He had formed his resolution, which was, that all
        these estates should be his again; he had formed his plan, too, which
        he instantly began to execute. He walked hastily forward, determined
        to seize the first opportunity, of however humble a kind, to gain any
        money, though it were ever so despicable a trifle, and resolved
        absolutely not to</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg

        help it, a farthing of whatever he might obtain. The first thing that
        drew his attention was a heap of coals shot out of carts on the
        pavement before a house. He offered himself to shovel or wheel them
        into the place where they were to be laid, and was employed. He
        received a few pence for the labor; and then, in pursuance of the
        saving part of his plan, requested some small gratuity of meat and
        drink, which was given him. He then looked out for the next thing
        that might chance; and went, with indefatigable industry, through a
        succession of servile employments in different places, of longer and
        shorter duration, still scrupulous in avoiding, as far as possible,
        the expense of a penny. He promptly seized every opportunity which
        could advance his design, without regarding the meanness of
        occupation or appearance. By this method he had gained, after a
        considerable time, money enough to purchase in order to sell again a
        few cattle, of which he had taken pains to understand the value. He
        speedily but cautiously turned his first gains into second
        advantages; retained without a single deviation his extreme
        parsimony; and thus advanced by degrees into larger transactions and
        incipient wealth. I did not hear, or have forgotten, the continued
        course of his life, but the final result was, that he more than
        recovered his lost possessions, and died an inveterate miser, worth
        £60,000.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_94" id="noteref_94" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a></p>

        life was meaningless took only this finite life into account. He was
        looking for the value of one finite term in that of another, and the
        whole result could only be one of those indeterminate equations in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet how believe as
        the common people believe, steeped as they are in grossest
        superstition? It is impossible,—but yet their life! their life! It is
        normal. It is happy! It is an answer to the question!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Little by little,
        Tolstoy came to the settled conviction—he says it took him two years
        to arrive there—that his trouble had not been with life in general,
        not with the common life of common men, but with the life of the
        upper, intellectual, artistic classes, the life which he had
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg185"/> personally always led, the
        cerebral life, the life of conventionality, artificiality, and
        personal ambition. He had been living wrongly and must change. To
        work for animal needs, to abjure lies and vanities, to relieve common
        wants, to be simple, to believe in God, therein lay happiness
        again.</p>

        mysterious noises. I listened, and my thought went back to what for
        these three years it always was busy with—the quest of God. But the
        idea of him, I said, how did I ever come by the
        idea?</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">And again there arose in me, with this thought,

          a meaning.... Why do I look farther? a voice within me asked. He is
          there: he, without whom one cannot live. To acknowledge God and to
          live are one and the same thing. God is what life is. Well, then!
          live, seek God, and there will be no life without
          him....</span></span></p>

          was saved from suicide. Just how or when the change took place I
          cannot tell. But as insensibly and gradually as the force of life
          had been annulled within me, and I had reached my moral death-bed,
          just as gradually and imperceptibly did the energy of life come
          back. And what was strange was that this energy that came back was
          nothing new. It was my ancient juvenile force of faith, the belief
          that the sole purpose of my life was to be</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">better</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. I gave up the life of the conventional world,
          recognizing it to be no life, but a parody on life, which its
          superfluities simply keep us from comprehending,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">—and
          Tolstoy thereupon embraced the life of the peasants, and has felt

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As I interpret his
        melancholy, then, it was not merely an accidental vitiation of his
        humors, though it was doubtless also that. It was logically called
        for by the clash <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg
        186]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg186"/>
        between his inner character and his outer activities and aims.
        Although a literary artist, Tolstoy was one of those primitive oaks
        of men to whom the superfluities and insincerities, the cupidities,
        complications, and cruelties of our polite civilization are
        profoundly unsatisfying, and for whom the eternal veracities lie with
        more natural and animal things. His crisis was the getting of his
        soul in order, the discovery of its genuine habitat and vocation, the
        escape from falsehoods into what for him were ways of truth. It was a
        case of heterogeneous personality tardily and slowly finding its
        unity and level. And though not many of us can imitate Tolstoy, not
        having enough, perhaps, of the aboriginal human marrow in our bones,
        most of us may at least feel as if it might be better for us if we
        could.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bunyan's recovery
        seems to have been even slower. For years together he was alternately
        haunted with texts of Scripture, now up and now down, but at last
        with an ever growing relief in his salvation through the blood of
        Christ.</p>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bunyan became a
        minister of the gospel, and in spite of his neurotic constitution,
        and of the twelve years he lay in prison for his non-conformity, his
        life was turned to active use. He was a peacemaker and doer of good,
        and the immortal Allegory which he wrote has brought the very spirit
        of religious patience home to English hearts.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But neither Bunyan
        nor Tolstoy could become what we have called healthy-minded. They had
        drunk too deeply of the cup of bitterness ever to forget its taste,
        and their redemption is into a universe two stories deep. Each of
        them realized a good which broke the effective edge of his sadness;
        yet the sadness was preserved as a minor ingredient in the heart of
        the faith by which it was overcome. The fact of interest for us is
        that as a matter of fact they could and did find <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">something</span></em>
        welling up in the inner reaches of their consciousness, by which such
        extreme sadness could be overcome. Tolstoy does well to talk of it as
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that by
        which men live</span></em>; for that is exactly what it is, a
        stimulus, an excitement, a faith, a force that re-infuses the
        positive willingness to live, even in full presence of the evil
        perceptions that erewhile made life seem unbearable. For Tolstoy's
        perceptions of evil <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg
        188]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg188"/>
        appear within their sphere to have remained unmodified. His later
        works show him implacable to the whole system of official values: the
        ignobility of fashionable life; the infamies of empire; the
        spuriousness of the church, the vain conceit of the professions; the
        meannesses and cruelties that go with great success; and every other
        pompous crime and lying institution of this world. To all patience
        with such things his experience has been for him a permanent ministry
        of death.</p>

<span style="font-size: 173%">Lecture IX. Conversion.</span></h1>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To be converted,
        to be regenerated, to receive grace, to experience religion, to gain
        an assurance, are so many phrases which denote the process, gradual
        or sudden, by which a self hitherto divided, and consciously wrong
        inferior and unhappy, becomes unified and consciously right superior
        and happy, in consequence of its firmer hold upon religious
        realities. This at least is what conversion signifies in general
        terms, whether or not we believe that a direct divine operation is
        needed to bring such a moral change about.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before entering
        upon a minuter study of the process, let me enliven our understanding
        of the definition by a concrete example. I choose the quaint case of
        an unlettered man, Stephen H. Bradley, whose experience is related in
        a scarce American pamphlet.<a href="#note_98" id="noteref_98" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I select this case
        because it shows how in these inner alterations one may find one
        unsuspected depth below another, as if the possibilities of character
        lay disposed in a series of layers or shells, of whose existence we
        have no premonitory knowledge.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bradley thought
        that he had been already fully converted at the age of fourteen.</p>

        The next day I rejoiced with trembling; soon after, my happiness was
        so great that I said that I wanted to die; this world had no place in
        my affections, as I knew of, and every day appeared as solemn to me
        as the Sabbath. I had an ardent desire that all mankind might feel as
        I did; I wanted to have them all love God supremely. Previous to this
        time I was very selfish and self-righteous; but now I desired the
        welfare of all mankind, and could with a feeling heart forgive my
        worst enemies, and I felt as if I should be willing to bear the
        scoffs and sneers of any person, and suffer anything for His sake, if

          not appear to satisfy them; they said they</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">knew they</span></em>
<span style="font-size: 90%">had it. I requested them to pray for
          me, thinking with myself, that if I had not got religion now, after
          so long a time professing to be a Christian, that it was time I
          had, and hoped their prayers would be answered in my
          behalf.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">One Sabbath, I went to hear the Methodist at the
          Academy. He spoke of the ushering in of the day of general
          judgment; and he set it forth in such a solemn and terrible manner
          as I never heard before. The scene of that day appeared to be
          taking place, and so awakened were all the powers of my mind that,
          like Felix, I trembled involuntarily on the bench where I was
          sitting, though I felt nothing at heart. The next day evening I
          went to hear him again. He took his text from Revelation:</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">And I saw the
          dead, small and great, stand before God.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">And
          he represented the terrors of that day in such a manner that it
          appeared as if it would melt the heart of stone. When he finished
          his discourse, an old gentleman turned to me and said,</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">This is what
          I call preaching.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">I
          thought the same; but my feelings were still unmoved by what he
          said, and I did not enjoy religion, but I believe he
          did.</span></span></p>

          to this that I could have experienced the power of the Holy Spirit
          in the manner which I did, I could not have believed it, and should
          have thought the person deluded that told me so. I went directly
          home after the meeting, and when I got home I wondered what made me
          feel so stupid. I retired to rest soon after I got home, and felt
          indifferent to the things of religion until I began to be exercised
          by the Holy Spirit, which began in about five minutes after, in the
          following manner:—</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">At first, I began to feel my heart beat very quick
          all on a sudden, which made me at first think that perhaps
          something is going to ail me, though I was not alarmed, for I felt
          no pain. My heart increased in its beating, which soon convinced me
          that it was the Holy Spirit from the effect it had on me. I began
          to feel exceedingly happy and humble, and such a sense of
          unworthiness as I never felt before. I could not very well help
          speaking out, which I did, and said, Lord, I do not deserve this
          happiness, or words to that effect, while there was a stream
          (resembling air in feeling) came into my mouth and heart in a more
          sensible manner than that of drinking anything, which continued, as
          near as I could judge, five minutes or more, which appeared to be
          the cause of such a palpitation of my heart. It took complete
          possession of my soul, and I am certain that I desired the Lord,
          while in the midst of it, not to give me any more happiness, for it
          seemed as if I could not contain what I had got. My heart seemed as
          if it would burst, but it did not stop until I felt as if I was
          unutterably full of the love and grace of God. In the mean time
          while thus exercised, a thought arose in my mind, what can it mean?
          and all at once, as if to answer it, my memory became exceedingly
          clear, and it appeared to me just as if the New Testament was
          placed open before me, eighth chapter of Romans, and as light as if
          some candle lighted was held for me to read the 26th and 27th
          verses of that chapter, and I read these words:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">The Spirit helpeth our infirmities with groanings
          which cannot be uttered.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">And
          all the time that my heart was a-beating, it made me groan like a
          person in distress, which was not very easy to stop, though I was
          in no pain at all, and my brother being in bed in</span>

          me if I had got the toothache. I told him no, and that he might get
          to sleep. I tried to stop. I felt unwilling to go to sleep myself,
          I was so happy, fearing I should lose it—thinking within
          myself</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">And while I lay
          reflecting, after my heart stopped beating, feeling as if my soul
          was full of the Holy Spirit, I thought that perhaps there might be
          angels hovering round my bed. I felt just as if I wanted to
          converse with them, and finally I spoke, saying,</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">O ye
          affectionate angels! how is it that ye can take so much interest in

<span style="font-size: 90%">After this, with difficulty I got to
          sleep; and when I awoke in the morning my first thoughts were: What
          has become of my happiness? and, feeling a degree of it in my
          heart, I asked for more, which was given to me as quick as thought.
          I then got up to dress myself, and found to my surprise that I
          could but just stand. It appeared to me as if it was a little
          heaven upon earth. My soul felt as completely raised above the
          fears of death as of going to sleep; and like a bird in a cage, I
          had a desire, if it was the will of God, to get released from my
          body and to dwell with Christ, though willing to live to do good to
          others, and to warn sinners to repent. I went downstairs feeling as
          solemn as if I had lost all my friends, and thinking with myself,
          that I would not let my parents know it until I had first looked
          into the Testament. I went directly to the shelf and looked into
          it, at the eighth chapter of Romans, and every verse seemed to
          almost speak and to confirm it to be truly the Word of God, and as
          if my feelings corresponded with the meaning of the word. I then
          told my parents of it, and told them that I thought that they must
          see that when I spoke, that it was not my own voice, for it
          appeared so to me. My speech seemed entirely under the control of
          the Spirit within me; I do not mean that the words which I spoke
          were not my own, for they were. I thought that I was influenced
          similar to the Apostles on the day of Pentecost (with the exception
          of having power to give it to others, and doing</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg193"/><span style="font-size: 90%">what they
          did). After breakfast I went round to converse with my neighbors on
          religion, which I could not have been hired to have done before
          this, and at their request I prayed with them, though I had never
          prayed in public before.</span></span></p>

          sending the Holy Spirit down into our hearts, or mine at least, and

        Bradley and his conversion, of the effect of which upon his later
        life we gain no information. Now for a minuter survey of the
        constituent elements of the conversion process.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If you open the
        chapter on Association, of any treatise on Psychology, you will read
        that a man's ideas, aims, and objects form diverse internal groups
        and systems, relatively independent of one another. Each <span class="tei tei-q">“aim”</span> which he follows awakens a certain specific
        kind of interested excitement, and gathers a certain group of ideas
        together in subordination to it as its associates; and if the aims
        and excitements are distinct in kind, their groups of ideas may have
        little in common. When one group is present and engrosses the
        interest, all the ideas connected with other groups may be excluded
        from the mental field. The President of the United States when, with
        paddle, gun, and fishing-rod, he goes camping in the wilderness for a
        vacation, changes his system of ideas from top to bottom. The
        presidential anxieties have lapsed into the background entirely; the
        official habits are replaced by the habits of a son of nature, and
        those who knew the man only as the strenuous magistrate would not
        <span class="tei tei-q">“know him for the same person”</span> if they
        saw him as the camper.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If now he should
        never go back, and never again <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg194"/> suffer political interests to gain dominion
        over him, he would be for practical intents and purposes a
        permanently transformed being. Our ordinary alterations of character,
        as we pass from one of our aims to another, are not commonly called
        transformations, because each of them is so rapidly succeeded by
        another in the reverse direction; but whenever one aim grows so
        stable as to expel definitively its previous rivals from the
        individual's life, we tend to speak of the phenomenon, and perhaps to
        wonder at it, as a <span class="tei tei-q">“transformation.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These alternations
        are the completest of the ways in which a self may be divided. A less
        complete way is the simultaneous coexistence of two or more different
        groups of aims, of which one practically holds the right of way and
        instigates activity, whilst the others are only pious wishes, and
        never practically come to anything. Saint Augustine's aspirations to
        a purer life, in our last lecture, were for a while an example.
        Another would be the President in his full pride of office, wondering
        whether it were not all vanity, and whether the life of a
        wood-chopper were not the wholesomer destiny. Such fleeting
        aspirations are mere <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">velleitates</span></span>, whimsies. They exist
        on the remoter outskirts of the mind, and the real self of the man,
        the centre of his energies, is occupied with an entirely different
        system. As life goes on, there is a constant change of our interests,
        and a consequent change of place in our systems of ideas, from more
        central to more peripheral, and from more peripheral to more central
        parts of consciousness. I remember, for instance, that one evening
        when I was a youth, my father read aloud from a Boston newspaper that
        part of Lord Gifford's will which founded these four lectureships. At
        that time I did not think of being a teacher of philosophy: and what
        I listened to was as remote from my own life <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg195"/> as if it related to the planet Mars. Yet here I
        am, with the Gifford system part and parcel of my very self, and all
        my energies, for the time being, devoted to successfully identifying
        myself with it. My soul stands now planted in what once was for it a
        practically unreal object, and speaks from it as from its proper
        habitat and centre.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When I say
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Soul,”</span> you need not take me in the
        ontological sense unless you prefer to; for although ontological
        language is instinctive in such matters, yet Buddhists or Humians can
        perfectly well describe the facts in the phenomenal terms which are
        their favorites. For them the soul is only a succession of fields of
        consciousness: yet there is found in each field a part, or sub-field,
        which figures as focal and contains the excitement, and from which,
        as from a centre, the aim seems to be taken. Talking of this part, we
        involuntarily apply words of perspective to distinguish it from the
        rest, words like <span class="tei tei-q">“here,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“this,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“now,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“mine,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“me”</span>; and we ascribe to the other parts the
        positions <span class="tei tei-q">“there,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“then,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“that,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“his”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“thine,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“it,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“not me.”</span> But a <span class="tei tei-q">“here”</span> can change to a <span class="tei tei-q">“there,”</span> and a <span class="tei tei-q">“there”</span> become a <span class="tei tei-q">“here,”</span> and what was <span class="tei tei-q">“mine”</span> and what was <span class="tei tei-q">“not
        mine”</span> change their places.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What brings such
        changes about is the way in which emotional excitement alters. Things
        hot and vital to us to-day are cold to-morrow. It is as if seen from
        the hot parts of the field that the other parts appear to us, and
        from these hot parts personal desire and volition make their sallies.
        They are in short the centres of our dynamic energy, whereas the cold
        parts leave us indifferent and passive in proportion to their
        coldness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether such
        language be rigorously exact is for the present of no importance. It
        is exact enough, if you <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg
        196]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg196"/>
        recognize from your own experience the facts which I seek to
        designate by it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now there may be
        great oscillation in the emotional interest, and the hot places may
        shift before one almost as rapidly as the sparks that run through
        burnt-up paper. Then we have the wavering and divided self we heard
        so much of in the previous lecture. Or the focus of excitement and
        heat, the point of view from which the aim is taken, may come to lie
        permanently within a certain system; and then, if the change be a
        religious one, we call it a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conversion</span></em>, especially if it be by
        crisis, or sudden.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us hereafter,
        in speaking of the hot place in a man's consciousness, the group of
        ideas to which he devotes himself, and from which he works, call it
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        habitual centre of his personal energy</span></em>. It makes a great
        difference to a man whether one set of his ideas, or another, be the
        centre of his energy; and it makes a great difference, as regards any
        set of ideas which he may possess, whether they become central or
        remain peripheral in him. To say that a man is <span class="tei tei-q">“converted”</span> means, in these terms, that religious
        ideas, previously peripheral in his consciousness, now take a central
        place, and that religious aims form the habitual centre of his
        energy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now if you ask of
        psychology just <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how</span></em> the excitement shifts in a man's
        mental system, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> aims that were peripheral become
        at a certain moment central, psychology has to reply that although
        she can give a general description of what happens, she is unable in
        a given case to account accurately for all the single forces at work.
        Neither an outside observer nor the Subject who undergoes the process
        can explain fully how particular experiences are able to change one's
        centre of energy so decisively, or why they so often have to bide
        their hour to do so. We have a thought, or we perform an act,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg197"/> repeatedly, but on a certain
        day the real meaning of the thought peals through us for the first
        time, or the act has suddenly turned into a moral impossibility. All
        we know is that there are dead feelings, dead ideas, and cold
        beliefs, and there are hot and live ones; and when one grows hot and
        alive within us, everything has to re-crystallize about it. We may
        say that the heat and liveliness mean only the <span class="tei tei-q">“motor efficacy,”</span> long deferred but now operative,
        of the idea; but such talk itself is only circumlocution, for whence
        the sudden motor efficacy? And our explanations then get so vague and
        general that one realizes all the more the intense individuality of
        the whole phenomenon.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the end we fall
        back on the hackneyed symbolism of a mechanical equilibrium. A mind
        is a system of ideas, each with the excitement it arouses, and with
        tendencies impulsive and inhibitive, which mutually check or
        reinforce one another. The collection of ideas alters by subtraction
        or by addition in the course of experience, and the tendencies alter
        as the organism gets more aged. A mental system may be undermined or
        weakened by this interstitial alteration just as a building is, and
        yet for a time keep upright by dead habit. But a new perception, a
        sudden emotional shock, or an occasion which lays bare the organic
        alteration, will make the whole fabric fall together; and then the
        centre of gravity sinks into an attitude more stable, for the new
        ideas that reach the centre in the rearrangement seem now to be
        locked there, and the new structure remains permanent.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Formed
        associations of ideas and habits are usually factors of retardation
        in such changes of equilibrium. New information, however acquired,
        plays an accelerating part in the changes; and the slow mutation of
        our instincts and propensities, under the <span class="tei tei-q">“unimaginable touch <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg198"/> of time”</span> has an enormous influence.
        Moreover, all these influences may work subconsciously or half
        unconsciously.<a href="#note_99" id="noteref_99" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a> And when
        you get a Subject in whom the subconscious life—of which I must speak
        more fully soon—is largely developed, and in whom motives habitually
        ripen in silence, you get a case of which you can never give a full
        account, and in which, both to the Subject and the onlookers, there
        may appear an element of marvel. Emotional occasions, especially
        violent ones, are extremely potent in precipitating mental
        rearrangements. The sudden and explosive ways in which love,
        jealousy, guilt, fear, remorse, or anger can seize upon one are known
        to everybody.<a href="#note_100" id="noteref_100" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a> Hope,
        happiness, security, resolve, emotions characteristic of conversion,
        can be equally explosive. And emotions that come in this explosive
        way seldom leave things as they found them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In his recent work
        on the Psychology of Religion, Professor Starbuck of California has
        shown by a statistical <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg
        199]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg199"/>
        inquiry how closely parallel in its manifestations the ordinary
        <span class="tei tei-q">“conversion”</span> which occurs in young
        people brought up in evangelical circles is to that growth into a
        larger spiritual life which is a normal phase of adolescence in every
        class of human beings. The age is the same, falling usually between
        fourteen and seventeen. The symptoms are the same,—sense of
        incompleteness and imperfection; brooding, depression, morbid
        introspection, and sense of sin; anxiety about the hereafter;
        distress over doubts, and the like. And the result is the same,—a
        happy relief and objectivity, as the confidence in self gets greater
        through the adjustment of the faculties to the wider outlook. In
        spontaneous religious awakening, apart from revivalistic examples,
        and in the ordinary storm and stress and moulting-time of
        adolescence, we also may meet with mystical experiences, astonishing
        the subjects by their suddenness, just as in revivalistic conversion.
        The analogy, in fact, is complete; and Starbuck's conclusion as to
        these ordinary youthful conversions would seem to be the only sound
        one: Conversion is in its essence a normal adolescent phenomenon,
        incidental to the passage from the child's small universe to the
        wider intellectual and spiritual life of maturity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Theology,”</span> says Dr. Starbuck, <span class="tei tei-q">“takes the adolescent tendencies and builds upon them; it
        sees that the essential thing in adolescent growth is bringing the
        person out of childhood into the new life of maturity and personal
        insight. It accordingly brings those means to bear which will
        intensify the normal tendencies. It shortens up the period of
        duration of storm and stress.”</span> The conversion phenomena of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“conviction of sin”</span> last, by this
        investigator's statistics, about one fifth as long as the periods of
        adolescent storm and stress phenomena of which he also got
        statistics, but they are very much more intense. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg200"/> Bodily accompaniments, loss of sleep and
        appetite, for example, are much more frequent in them. <span class="tei tei-q">“The essential distinction appears to be that conversion
        intensifies but shortens the period by bringing the person to a
        definite crisis.”</span><a href="#note_101" id="noteref_101" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conversions
        which Dr. Starbuck here has in mind are of course mainly those of
        very commonplace persons, kept true to a pre-appointed type by
        instruction, appeal, and example. The particular form which they
        affect is the result of suggestion and imitation.<a href="#note_102" id="noteref_102" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">102</span></span></a> If they
        went through their growth-crisis in other faiths and other countries,
        although the essence of the change would be the same (since it is one
        in the main so inevitable), its accidents would be different. In
        Catholic lands, for example, and in our own Episcopalian sects, no
        such anxiety and conviction of sin is usual as in sects that
        encourage revivals. The sacraments being more relied on in these more
        strictly ecclesiastical bodies, the individual's personal acceptance
        of salvation needs less to be accentuated and led up
        to.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg201"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But every
        imitative phenomenon must once have had its original, and I propose
        that for the future we keep as close as may be to the more first-hand
        and original forms of experience. These are more likely to be found
        in sporadic adult cases.</p>

        in a valuable article on the psychology of conversion,<a href="#note_103" id="noteref_103" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">103</span></span></a>
        subordinates the theological aspect of the religious life almost
        entirely to its moral aspect. The religious sense he defines as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the feeling of un-wholeness, of moral
        imperfection, of sin, to use the technical word, accompanied by the
        yearning after the peace of unity.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The word <span class="tei tei-q">‘religion,’</span> ”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“is getting more and more to signify the conglomerate of
        desires and emotions springing from the sense of sin and its
        release”</span>; and he gives a large number of examples, in which
        the sin ranges from drunkenness to spiritual pride, to show that the
        sense of it may beset one and crave relief as urgently as does the
        anguish of the sickened flesh or any form of physical misery.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Undoubtedly this
        conception covers an immense number of cases. A good one to use as an
        example is that of Mr. S. H. Hadley, who after his conversion became
        an active and useful rescuer of drunkards in New York. His experience
        runs as follows:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">One Tuesday evening I sat in a saloon in Harlem, a
        homeless, friendless, dying drunkard. I had pawned or sold everything
        that would bring a drink. I could not sleep unless I was dead drunk.
        I had not eaten for days, and for four nights preceding I had
        suffered with delirium tremens, or the horrors, from midnight till
        morning. I had often said,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I will never be a tramp. I will never be cornered,
          for when that time comes, if ever it comes, I will find a home in
          the bottom of the river.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">But
          the Lord so ordered it that when that time did come I was</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg202"/><span style="font-size: 90%">not able to walk one quarter of the way to the
          river. As I sat there thinking, I seemed to feel some great and
          mighty presence. I did not know then what it was. I did learn
          afterwards that it was Jesus, the sinner's friend. I walked up to
          the bar and pounded it with my fist till I made the glasses rattle.
          Those who stood by drinking looked on with scornful curiosity. I
          said I would never take another drink, if I died on the street, and
          really I felt as though that would happen before morning. Something
          said,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">If you want
          to keep this promise, go and have yourself locked
          up.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">I went to the nearest station-house and had myself
          locked up.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I was placed in a narrow cell, and it seemed as
          though all the demons that could find room came in that place with
          me. This was not all the company I had, either. No, praise the
          Lord; that dear Spirit that came to me in the saloon was present,
          and said, Pray. I did pray, and though I did not feel any great
          help, I kept on praying. As soon as I was able to leave my cell I
          was taken to the police court and remanded back to the cell. I was
          finally released, and found my way to my brother's house, where
          every care was given me. While lying in bed the admonishing Spirit
          never left me, and when I arose the following Sabbath morning I
          felt that day would decide my fate, and toward evening it came into
          my head to go to Jerry M'Auley's Mission. I went. The house was
          packed, and with great difficulty I made my way to the space near
          the platform. There I saw the apostle to the drunkard and the
          outcast—that man of God, Jerry M'Auley. He rose, and amid deep
          silence told his experience. There was a sincerity about this man
          that carried conviction with it, and I found myself saying,</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I wonder if
          God can save</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">me</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">?</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">I
          listened to the testimony of twenty-five or thirty persons, every
          one of whom had been saved from rum, and I made up my mind that I
          would be saved or die right there. When the invitation was given, I
          knelt down with a crowd of drunkards. Jerry made the first prayer.
          Then Mrs. M'Auley prayed fervently for us. Oh, what a conflict was
          going on for my poor soul! A blessed whisper said,</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Come</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">; the
          devil said,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Be
          careful.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">I halted but a moment, and then, with
          a breaking heart, I said,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Dear</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg203"/><span style="font-size: 90%">Jesus, can you
          help me?</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">Never with mortal tongue can I
          describe that moment. Although up to that moment my soul had been
          filled with indescribable gloom, I felt the glorious brightness of
          the noonday sun shine into my heart. I felt I was a free man. Oh,
          the precious feeling of safety, of freedom, of resting on Jesus! I
          felt that Christ with all his brightness and power had come into my
          life; that, indeed, old things had passed away and all things had
          become new.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">From that moment till now I have never wanted a
          drink of whiskey, and I have never seen money enough to make me
          take one. I promised God that night that if he would take away the
          appetite for strong drink, I would work for him all my life. He has
          done his part, and I have been trying to do
          mine.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_104" id="noteref_104" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">104</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dr. Leuba rightly
        remarks that there is little doctrinal theology in such an
        experience, which starts with the absolute need of a higher helper,
        and ends with the sense that he has helped us. He gives other cases
        of drunkards' conversions which are purely ethical, containing, as
        recorded, no theological beliefs whatever. John B. Gough's case, for
        instance, is practically, says Dr. Leuba, the conversion of an
        atheist—neither God nor Jesus being mentioned.<a href="#note_105" id="noteref_105" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a> But in
        spite of the importance of this type of regeneration, with little or
        no intellectual readjustment, this writer surely makes it too
        exclusive. It corresponds to the subjectively centred form of morbid
        melancholy, of which Bunyan and Alline were examples. But we saw in
        our seventh lecture that there are objective forms of melancholy
        also, in which the lack of rational <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg204"/> meaning of the universe, and of life anyhow, is
        the burden that weighs upon one—you remember Tolstoy's case.<a href="#note_106" id="noteref_106" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">106</span></span></a> So
        there are distinct elements in conversion, and their relations to
        individual lives deserve to be discriminated.<a href="#note_107" id="noteref_107" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">107</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some persons, for
        instance, never are, and possibly never under any circumstances could
        be, converted. Religious ideas cannot become the centre of their
        spiritual energy. They may be excellent persons, servants of God in
        practical ways, but they are not children of his kingdom. They are
        either incapable of imagining the invisible; or else, in the language
        of devotion, they are life-long subjects of <span class="tei tei-q">“barrenness”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“dryness.”</span> Such inaptitude for religious faith may
        in some cases be intellectual in its origin. Their religious
        faculties may be checked in their natural tendency to expand, by
        beliefs about the world that are inhibitive, the pessimistic and
        materialistic beliefs, for example, within which so many good souls,
        who in former times would have freely indulged their religious
        propensities, find themselves nowadays, as it were, frozen; or the
        agnostic vetoes upon faith as something weak and shameful, under
        which so many of us to-day lie cowering, afraid to use our instincts.
        In many persons such inhibitions are never overcome. To the end of
        their days they refuse to believe, their personal energy never gets
        to its religious centre, and the latter remains inactive in
        perpetuity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In other persons
        the trouble is profounder. There are men anæsthetic on the religious
        side, deficient in that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg
        205]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg205"/>
        category of sensibility. Just as a bloodless organism can never, in
        spite of all its goodwill, attain to the reckless <span class="tei tei-q">“animal spirits”</span> enjoyed by those of sanguine
        temperament; so the nature which is spiritually barren may admire and
        envy faith in others, but can never compass the enthusiasm and peace
        which those who are temperamentally qualified for faith enjoy. All
        this may, however, turn out eventually to have been a matter of
        temporary inhibition. Even late in life some thaw, some release may
        take place, some bolt be shot back in the barrenest breast, and the
        man's hard heart may soften and break into religious feeling. Such
        cases more than any others suggest the idea that sudden conversion is
        by miracle. So long as they exist, we must not imagine ourselves to
        deal with irretrievably fixed classes.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now there are two
        forms of mental occurrence in human beings, which lead to a striking
        difference in the conversion process, a difference to which Professor
        Starbuck has called attention. You know how it is when you try to
        recollect a forgotten name. Usually you help the recall by working
        for it, by mentally running over the places, persons, and things with
        which the word was connected. But sometimes this effort fails: you
        feel then as if the harder you tried the less hope there would be, as
        though the name were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">jammed</span></em>, and pressure in its
        direction only kept it all the more from rising. And then the
        opposite expedient often succeeds. Give up the effort entirely; think
        of something altogether different, and in half an hour the lost name
        comes sauntering into your mind, as Emerson says, as carelessly as if
        it had never been invited. Some hidden process was started in you by
        the effort, which went on after the effort ceased, and made the
        result come as if it came spontaneously. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg206"/> A certain music teacher, says Dr. Starbuck,
        says to her pupils after the thing to be done has been clearly
        pointed out, and unsuccessfully attempted: <span class="tei tei-q">“Stop trying and it will do itself!”</span><a href="#note_108" id="noteref_108" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">108</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is thus a
        conscious and voluntary way and an involuntary and unconscious way in
        which mental results may get accomplished; and we find both ways
        exemplified in the history of conversion, giving us two types, which
        Starbuck calls the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">volitional type</span></em> and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">type by
        self-surrender</span></em> respectively.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the volitional
        type the regenerative change is usually gradual, and consists in the
        building up, piece by piece, of a new set of moral and spiritual
        habits. But there are always critical points here at which the
        movement forward seems much more rapid. This psychological fact is
        abundantly illustrated by Dr. Starbuck. Our education in any
        practical accomplishment proceeds apparently by jerks and starts,
        just as the growth of our physical bodies does.</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">An athlete ... sometimes awakens suddenly to an
        understanding of the fine points of the game and to a real enjoyment
        of it, just as the convert awakens to an appreciation of religion. If
        he keeps on engaging in the sport, there may come a day when all at
        once the game plays itself through him—when he loses himself in some
        great contest. In the same way, a musician may suddenly reach a point
        at which pleasure in the technique of the art entirely falls away,
        and in some moment of inspiration he becomes the instrument through
        which music flows. The writer has chanced to hear two different
        married persons, both of whose wedded lives had been beautiful from
        the beginning, relate that not until a year or more after marriage
        did they awake to the full blessedness of married life. So it is with
        the religious experience of these persons we are
        studying.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_109" id="noteref_109" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a></p>
</div><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg207"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We shall erelong
        hear still more remarkable illustrations of subconsciously maturing
        processes eventuating in results of which we suddenly grow conscious.
        Sir William Hamilton and Professor Laycock of Edinburgh were among
        the first to call attention to this class of effects; but Dr.
        Carpenter first, unless I am mistaken, introduced the term
        <span class="tei tei-q">“unconscious cerebration,”</span> which has
        since then been a popular phrase of explanation. The facts are now
        known to us far more extensively than he could know them, and the
        adjective <span class="tei tei-q">“unconscious,”</span> being for
        many of them almost certainly a misnomer, is better replaced by the
        vaguer term <span class="tei tei-q">“subconscious”</span> or
        <span class="tei tei-q">“subliminal.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the volitional
        type of conversion it would be easy to give examples,<a href="#note_110" id="noteref_110" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a> but
        they are as a rule less interesting <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg208"/> than those of the self-surrender type, in which
        the subconscious effects are more abundant and often startling. I
        will therefore hurry to the latter, the more so because the
        difference between the two types is after all not radical. Even in
        the most voluntarily built-up sort of regeneration there are passages
        of partial self-surrender interposed; and in the great majority of
        all cases, when the will has done its uttermost towards bringing one
        close to the complete unification aspired after, it seems that the
        very last step must be left to other forces and performed without the
        help of its activity. In other words, self-surrender becomes then
        indispensable. <span class="tei tei-q">“The personal will,”</span>
        says Dr. Starbuck, <span class="tei tei-q">“must be given up. In many
        cases relief persistently refuses to come until the person ceases to
        resist, or to make an effort in the direction he desires to
        go.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dr. Starbuck gives
        an interesting, and it seems to me a true, account—so far as
        conceptions so schematic can claim truth at all—of the reasons why
        self-surrender at the last moment should be so indispensable. To
        begin with, there are two things in the mind of the candidate for
        conversion: first, the present incompleteness or wrongness, the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“sin”</span> which he is eager to escape
        from; and, second, the positive ideal which he longs to compass. Now
        with most of us the sense of our present wrongness is a far more
        distinct piece of our consciousness than is the imagination of any
        positive ideal we can aim at. In a majority of cases, indeed, the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“sin”</span> almost exclusively engrosses the
        attention, so that conversion is <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a process of
        struggling away from sin rather than of striving towards
        righteousness</span></em>.”</span><a href="#note_113" id="noteref_113" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a> A man's
        conscious wit and will, so far as they strain towards the ideal, are
        aiming at something only dimly and inaccurately imagined. Yet all the
        while the forces of mere organic ripening within him are going on
        towards their own prefigured result, and his conscious strainings are
        letting loose subconscious allies behind the scenes, which in their
        way work towards rearrangement; and the rearrangement towards which
        all these deeper forces tend is pretty surely definite, and
        definitely different from what he consciously conceives and
        determines. It may consequently be actually interfered with
        (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">jammed</span></em>, as it were, like the lost
        word when we seek too energetically to recall it), by his voluntary
        efforts slanting from the true direction.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Starbuck seems to
        put his finger on the root of the matter when he says that to
        exercise the personal will is still to live in the region where the
        imperfect self is the thing most emphasized. Where, on the contrary,
        the subconscious forces take the lead, it is more probably
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg210"/> the better self <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in posse</span></span> which directs the
        operation. Instead of being clumsily and vaguely aimed at from
        without, it is then itself the organizing centre. What then must the
        person do? <span class="tei tei-q">“He must relax,”</span> says Dr.
        Starbuck,—<span class="tei tei-q">“that is, he must fall back on the
        larger Power that makes for righteousness, which has been welling up
        in his own being, and let it finish in its own way the work it has
        begun.... The act of yielding, in this point of view, is giving one's
        self over to the new life, making it the centre of a new personality,
        and living, from within, the truth of it which had before been viewed
        objectively.”</span><a href="#note_114" id="noteref_114" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Man's extremity is God's opportunity”</span> is the
        theological way of putting this fact of the need of self-surrender;
        whilst the physiological way of stating it would be, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let one do all in one's power, and one's nervous system
        will do the rest.”</span> Both statements acknowledge the same
        fact.<a href="#note_115" id="noteref_115" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To state it in
        terms of our own symbolism: When the new centre of personal energy
        has been subconsciously incubated so long as to be just ready to open
        into flower, <span class="tei tei-q">“hands off”</span> is the only
        word for us, it must burst forth unaided!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have used the
        vague and abstract language of psychology. But since, in any terms,
        the crisis described is the throwing of our conscious selves upon the
        mercy of powers which, whatever they may be, are more ideal than we
        are actually, and make for our redemption, you see why self-surrender
        has been and always must be regarded as the vital turning-point of
        the religious life, so far as the religious life is spiritual and no
        affair of outer works and ritual and sacraments. One may say that the
        whole development of Christianity in inwardness <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg211"/> has consisted in little more than the
        greater and greater emphasis attached to this crisis of
        self-surrender. From Catholicism to Lutheranism, and then to
        Calvinism; from that to Wesleyanism; and from this, outside of
        technical Christianity altogether, to pure <span class="tei tei-q">“liberalism”</span> or transcendental idealism, whether
        or not of the mind-cure type, taking in the mediæval mystics, the
        quietists, the pietists, and quakers by the way, we can trace the
        stages of progress towards the idea of an immediate spiritual help,
        experienced by the individual in his forlornness and standing in no
        essential need of doctrinal apparatus or propitiatory machinery.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Psychology and
        religion are thus in perfect harmony up to this point, since both
        admit that there are forces seemingly outside of the conscious
        individual that bring redemption to his life. Nevertheless
        psychology, defining these forces as <span class="tei tei-q">“subconscious,”</span> and speaking of their effects as
        due to <span class="tei tei-q">“incubation,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“cerebration,”</span> implies that they do not transcend
        the individual's personality; and herein she diverges from Christian
        theology, which insists that they are direct supernatural operations
        of the Deity. I propose to you that we do not yet consider this
        divergence final, but leave the question for a while in
        abeyance—continued inquiry may enable us to get rid of some of the
        apparent discord.</p>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Revert, then, for
        a moment more to the psychology of self-surrender.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When you find a
        man living on the ragged edge of his consciousness, pent in to his
        sin and want and incompleteness, and consequently inconsolable, and
        then simply tell him that all is well with him, that he must stop his
        worry, break with his discontent, and give up his anxiety, you seem
        to him to come with pure absurdities. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg212"/> only positive consciousness he has tells him
        that all is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> well, and the better way you
        offer sounds simply as if you proposed to him to assert cold-blooded
        falsehoods. <span class="tei tei-q">“The will to believe”</span>
        cannot be stretched as far as that. We can make ourselves more
        faithful to a belief of which we have the rudiments, but we cannot
        create a belief out of whole cloth when our perception actively
        assures us of its opposite. The better mind proposed to us comes in
        that case in the form of a pure negation of the only mind we have,
        and we cannot actively will a pure negation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are only two
        ways in which it is possible to get rid of anger, worry, fear,
        despair, or other undesirable affections. One is that an opposite
        affection should overpoweringly break over us, and the other is by
        getting so exhausted with the struggle that we have to stop,—so we
        drop down, give up, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">don't care</span></em> any longer. Our emotional
        brain-centres strike work, and we lapse into a temporary apathy. Now
        there is documentary proof that this state of temporary exhaustion
        not infrequently forms part of the conversion crisis. So long as the
        egoistic worry of the sick soul guards the door, the expansive
        confidence of the soul of faith gains no presence. But let the former
        faint away, even but for a moment, and the latter can profit by the
        opportunity, and, having once acquired possession, may retain it.
        Carlyle's Teufelsdröckh passes from the everlasting No to the
        everlasting Yes through a <span class="tei tei-q">“Centre of
        Indifference.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let me give you a
        good illustration of this feature in the conversion process. That
        genuine saint, David Brainerd, describes his own crisis in the
        following words:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">One morning, while I was walking in a solitary place
        as usual, I at once saw that all my contrivances and projects to
        effect or procure deliverance and salvation for myself were utterly
        in</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg
        213]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg213"/><span style="font-size: 90%">vain; I was brought
        quite to a stand, as finding myself totally lost. I saw that it was
        forever impossible for me to do anything towards helping or
        delivering myself, that I had made all the pleas I ever could have
        made to all eternity; and that all my pleas were vain, for I saw that
        self-interest had led me to pray, and that I had never once prayed
        from any respect to the glory of God. I saw that there was no
        necessary connection between my prayers and the bestowment of divine
        mercy; that they laid not the least obligation upon God to bestow his
        grace upon me; and that there was no more virtue or goodness in them
        than there would be in my paddling with my hand in the water. I saw
        that I had been heaping up my devotions before God, fasting, praying,
        etc., pretending, and indeed really thinking sometimes that I was
        aiming at the glory of God; whereas I never once truly intended it,
        but only my own happiness. I saw that as I had never done anything
        for God, I had no claim on anything from him but perdition, on
        account of my hypocrisy and mockery. When I saw evidently that I had
        regard to nothing but self-interest, then my duties appeared a vile
        mockery and a continual course of lies, for the whole was nothing but
        self-worship, and an horrid abuse of God.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I continued, as I remember, in this state of mind,
          from Friday morning till the Sabbath evening following (July 12,
          1739), when I was walking again in the same solitary place. Here,
          in a mournful melancholy state</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">I
          was attempting to pray; but found no heart to engage in that or any
          other duty; my former concern, exercise, and religious affections
          were now gone. I thought that the Spirit of God had quite left me;
          but still was not distressed; yet disconsolate, as if there was
          nothing in heaven or earth could make me happy. Having been thus
          endeavoring to pray—though, as I thought, very stupid and
          senseless</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">—for near half an
          hour; then, as I was walking in a thick grove, unspeakable glory
          seemed to open to the apprehension of my soul. I do not mean any
          external brightness, nor any imagination of a body of light, but it
          was a new inward apprehension or view that I had of God, such as I
          never had before, nor anything which had the least resemblance to
          it. I had no particular apprehension of any one person in</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg214"/><span style="font-size: 90%">the Trinity, either the Father, the Son, or the
          Holy Ghost; but it appeared to be Divine glory. My soul rejoiced
          with joy unspeakable, to see such a God, such a glorious Divine
          Being; and I was inwardly pleased and satisfied that he should be
          God over all for ever and ever. My soul was so captivated and
          delighted with the excellency of God that I was even swallowed up
          in him; at least to that degree that I had no thought about my own
          salvation, and scarce reflected that there was such a creature as
          myself. I continued in this state of inward joy, peace, and
          astonishing, till near dark without any sensible abatement; and
          then began to think and examine what I had seen; and felt sweetly
          composed in my mind all the evening following. I felt myself in a
          new world, and everything about me appeared with a different aspect
          from what it was wont to do. At this time, the way of salvation
          opened to me with such infinite wisdom, suitableness, and
          excellency, that I wondered I should ever think of any other way of
          salvation; was amazed that I had not dropped my own contrivances,
          and complied with this lovely, blessed, and excellent way before.
          If I could have been saved by my own duties or any other way that I
          had formerly contrived, my whole soul would now have refused it. I
          wondered that all the world did not see and comply with this way of
          salvation, entirely by the righteousness of
          Christ.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_116" id="noteref_116" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">116</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have italicized
        the passage which records the exhaustion of the anxious emotion
        hitherto habitual. In a large proportion, perhaps the majority, of
        reports, the writers speak as if the exhaustion of the lower and the
        entrance of the higher emotion were simultaneous,<a href="#note_117" id="noteref_117" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">117</span></span></a> yet

        the higher actively drove the lower out. This is undoubtedly true in
        a great many instances, as we shall presently see. But often there
        seems little doubt that both conditions—subconscious ripening of the
        one affection and exhaustion of the other—must simultaneously have
        conspired, in order to produce the result.</p>

        Conversion—Concluded.</span></h1>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this lecture we
        have to finish the subject of Conversion, considering at first those
        striking instantaneous instances of which Saint Paul's is the most
        eminent, and in which, often amid tremendous emotional excitement or
        perturbation of the senses, a complete division is established in the
        twinkling of an eye between the old life and the new. Conversion of
        this type is an important phase of religious experience, owing to the
        part which it has played in Protestant theology, and it behooves us
        to study it conscientiously on that account.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I think I had
        better cite two or three of these cases before proceeding to a more
        generalized account. One must know concrete instances first; for, as
        Professor Agassiz used to say, one can see no farther into a
        generalization than just so far as one's previous acquaintance with
        particulars enables one to take it in. I will go back, then, to the
        case of our friend Henry Alline, and quote his report of the 26th of
        March, 1775, on which his poor divided mind became unified for
        good.</p>

        lamenting my miserable lost and undone condition, and almost ready to
        sink under my burden, I thought I was in such a miserable case as
        never any man was before. I returned to the house, and when I got to
        the door, just as I was stepping off the threshold, the following
        impressions came into my mind like a powerful but small still voice.
        You have been seeking, praying,</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg218"/><span style="font-size: 90%">reforming,

        it towards your salvation? Are you any nearer to conversion now than
        when you first began? Are you any more prepared for heaven, or fitter
        to appear before the impartial bar of God, than when you first began
        to seek?</span></span></p>

          obliged to say that I did not think I was one step nearer than at
          first, but as much condemned, as much exposed, and as miserable as
          before. I cried out within myself, O Lord God, I am lost, and if
          thou, O Lord, dost not find out some new way, I know nothing of, I
          shall never be saved, for the ways and methods I have prescribed to
          myself have all failed me, and I am willing they should fail. O

          a drowning man that was just giving up to sink, and almost in an
          agony, I turned very suddenly round in my chair, and seeing part of
          an old Bible lying in one of the chairs, I caught hold of it in
          great haste; and opening it without any premeditation, cast my eyes
          on the 38th Psalm, which was the first time I ever saw the word of
          God: it took hold of me with such power that it seemed to go
          through my whole soul, so that it seemed as if God was praying in,
          with, and for me. About this time my father called the family to
          attend prayers; I attended, but paid no regard to what he said in
          his prayer, but continued praying in those words of the Psalm. Oh,
          help me, help me! cried I, thou Redeemer of souls, and save me, or
          I am gone forever; thou canst this night, if thou pleasest, with
          one drop of thy blood atone for my sins, and appease the wrath of
          an angry God. At that instant of time when I gave all up to him to
          do with me as he pleased, and was willing that God should rule over
          me at his pleasure, redeeming love broke into my soul with repeated
          scriptures, with such power that my whole soul seemed to be melted
          down with love; the burden of guilt and condemnation was gone,
          darkness was expelled, my heart humbled and filled with gratitude,
          and my whole soul, that was a few minutes ago groaning under
          mountains of death, and crying to an unknown God for help, was now
          filled with</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg
          219]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg219"/><span style="font-size: 90%">immortal love,
          soaring on the wings of faith, freed from the chains of death and
          darkness, and crying out, My Lord and my God; thou art my rock and
          my fortress, my shield and my high tower, my life, my joy, my
          present and my everlasting portion. Looking up, I thought I saw
          that same light [he had on more than one previous occasion seen
          subjectively a bright blaze of light], though it appeared
          different; and as soon as I saw it, the design was opened to me,
          according to his promise, and I was obliged to cry out: Enough,
          enough, O blessed God! The work of conversion, the change, and the
          manifestations of it are no more disputable than that light which I
          see, or anything that ever I saw.</span></span></p>

          hour after my soul was set at liberty, the Lord discovered to me my
          labor in the ministry and call to preach the gospel. I cried out,
          Amen, Lord, I'll go; send me, send me. I spent the greatest part of
          the night in ecstasies of joy, praising and adoring the Ancient of
          Days for his free and unbounded grace. After I had been so long in
          this transport and heavenly frame that my nature seemed to require
          sleep, I thought to close my eyes for a few moments; then the devil
          stepped in, and told me that if I went to sleep, I should lose it
          all, and when I should awake in the morning I would find it to be
          nothing but a fancy and delusion. I immediately cried out, O Lord
          God, if I am deceived, undeceive me.</span></span></p>

          seemed to be refreshed with sleep; and when I awoke, the first
          inquiry was, Where is my God? And in an instant of time, my soul
          seemed awake in and with God, and surrounded by the arms of
          everlasting love. About sunrise I arose with joy to relate to my
          parents what God had done for my soul, and declared to them the
          miracle of God's unbounded grace. I took a Bible to show them the
          words that were impressed by God on my soul the evening before; but
          when I came to open the Bible, it appeared all new to
          me.</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Young Mr. Alline,
        after the briefest of delays, and with no book-learning but his
        Bible, and no teaching save that of his own experience, became a
        Christian minister, and thenceforward his life was fit to rank, for
        its austerity and single-mindedness, with that of the most devoted
        saints. But happy as he became in his strenuous way, he never got his
        taste for even the most innocent carnal pleasures back. We must class
        him, like Bunyan and Tolstoy, amongst those upon whose soul the iron
        of melancholy left a permanent imprint. His redemption was into
        another universe than this mere natural world, and life remained for
        him a sad and patient trial. Years later we can find him making such
        an entry as this in his diary: <span class="tei tei-q">“On Wednesday
        the 12th I preached at a wedding, and had the happiness thereby to be
        the means of excluding carnal mirth.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next case I
        will give is that of a correspondent of Professor Leuba, printed in
        the latter's article, already cited, in vol. vi. of the American
        Journal of Psychology. This subject was an Oxford graduate, the son
        of a clergyman, and the story resembles in many points the classic
        case of Colonel Gardiner, which everybody may be supposed to know.
        Here it is, somewhat abridged:—</p>

        conversion I never darkened the door of my father's church, although
        I lived with him for eight years, making what money I wanted by
        journalism, and spending it in high carousal with any one who would
        sit with me and drink it away. So I lived, sometimes drunk for a week
        together, and then a terrible repentance, and would not touch a drop
        for a whole month.</span></span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg221"/>

          years of age, I never had a desire to reform on religious grounds.
          But all my pangs were due to some terrible remorse I used to feel
          after a heavy carousal, the remorse taking the shape of regret
          after my folly in wasting my life in such a way—a man of superior
          talents and education. This terrible remorse turned me gray in one
          night, and whenever it came upon me I was perceptibly grayer the
          next morning. What I suffered in this way is beyond the expression
          of words. It was hell-fire in all its most dreadful tortures. Often
          did I vow that if I got over</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">this time</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">I
          would reform. Alas, in about three days I fully recovered, and was
          as happy as ever. So it went on for years, but, with a physique
          like a rhinoceros, I always recovered, and as long as I let drink
          alone, no man was as capable of enjoying life as I
          was.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I was converted in my own bedroom in my father's
          rectory house at precisely three o'clock in the afternoon of a hot
          July day (July 13, 1886). I was in perfect health, having been off
          from the drink for nearly a month. I was in no way troubled about
          my soul. In fact, God was not in my thoughts that day. A young lady
          friend sent me a copy of Professor Drummond's Natural Law in the
          Spiritual World, asking me my opinion of it as a literary work
          only. Being proud of my critical talents and wishing to enhance
          myself in my new friend's esteem, I took the book to my bedroom for
          quiet, intending to give it a thorough study, and then write her
          what I thought of it. It was here that God met me face to face, and
          I shall never forget the meeting.</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">He that hath the Son hath life eternal, he that
          hath not the Son hath not life.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">I had
          read this scores of times before, but this made all the difference.
          I was now in God's presence and my attention was absolutely</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">soldered</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">on to
          this verse, and I was not allowed to proceed with the book till I
          had fairly considered what these words really involved. Only then
          was I allowed to proceed, feeling all the while that there was
          another being in my bedroom, though not seen by me. The stillness
          was very marvelous, and I felt supremely happy. It was most
          unquestionably shown me, in one second of time, that I had never
          touched the Eternal: and</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg222"/><span style="font-size: 90%">that if I died
          then, I must inevitably be lost. I was undone. I knew it as well as
          I now know I am saved. The Spirit of God showed it me in ineffable
          love; there was no terror in it; I felt God's love so powerfully
          upon me that only a mighty sorrow crept over me that I had lost all
          through my own folly; and what was I to do? What could I do? I did
          not repent even; God never asked me to repent. All I felt
          was</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I am
          undone,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">and
          God cannot help it, although he loves me. No fault on the part of
          the Almighty. All the time I was supremely happy: I felt like a
          little child before his father. I had done wrong, but my Father did
          not scold me, but loved me most wondrously. Still my doom was
          sealed. I was lost to a certainty, and being naturally of a brave
          disposition I did not quail under it, but deep sorrow for the past,
          mixed with regret for what I had lost, took hold upon me, and my
          soul thrilled within me to think it was all over. Then there crept
          in upon me so gently, so lovingly, so unmistakably, a way of
          escape, and what was it after all? The old, old story over again,
          told in the simplest way:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">There is no name under heaven whereby ye can be
          saved except that of the Lord Jesus Christ.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">No
          words were spoken to me; my soul seemed to see my Saviour in the
          spirit, and from that hour to this, nearly nine years now, there
          has never been in my life one doubt that the Lord Jesus Christ and
          God the Father both worked upon me that afternoon in July, both
          differently, and both in the most perfect love conceivable, and I
          rejoiced there and then in a conversion so astounding that the
          whole village heard of it in less than twenty-four
          hours.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">But a time of trouble was yet to come. The day
          after my conversion I went into the hay-field to lend a hand with
          the harvest, and not having made any promise to God to abstain or
          drink in moderation only, I took too much and came home drunk. My
          poor sister was heart-broken; and I felt ashamed of myself and got
          to my bedroom at once, where she followed me, weeping copiously.
          She said I had been converted and fallen away instantly. But
          although I was quite full of drink (not muddled, however), I knew
          that God's work begun in me was not going to be wasted. About
          midday I</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg
          223]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg223"/><span style="font-size: 90%">made on my knees
          the first prayer before God for twenty years. I did not ask to be
          forgiven; I felt that was no good, for I would be sure to fall
          again. Well, what did I do? I committed myself to him in the
          profoundest belief that my individuality was going to be destroyed,
          that he would take all from me, and I was willing. In such a
          surrender lies the secret of a holy life. From that hour drink has
          had no terrors for me: I never touch it, never want it. The same
          thing occurred with my pipe: after being a regular smoker from my
          twelfth year the desire for it went at once, and has never
          returned. So with every known sin, the deliverance in each case
          being permanent and complete. I have had no temptation since
          conversion, God seemingly having shut out Satan from that course
          with me. He gets a free hand in other ways, but never on sins of
          the flesh. Since I gave up to God all ownership in my own life, he
          has guided me in a thousand ways, and has opened my path in a way
          almost incredible to those who do not enjoy the blessing of a truly
          surrendered life.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So much for our
        graduate of Oxford, in whom you notice the complete abolition of an
        ancient appetite as one of the conversion's fruits.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most curious
        record of sudden conversion with which I am acquainted is that of M.
        Alphonse Ratisbonne, a freethinking French Jew, to Catholicism, at
        Rome in 1842. In a letter to a clerical friend, written a few months
        later, the convert gives a palpitating account of the
        circumstances.<a href="#note_121" id="noteref_121" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a> The
        predisposing conditions appear to have been slight. He had an elder
        brother who had been converted and was a Catholic priest. He was
        himself irreligious, and nourished an antipathy to the apostate
        brother and generally to his <span class="tei tei-q">“cloth.”</span>
        Finding himself at Rome in his twenty-ninth year, he fell in with a
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg224"/> French gentleman who tried to
        make a proselyte of him, but who succeeded no farther after two or
        three conversations than to get him to hang (half jocosely) a
        religious medal round his neck, and to accept and read a copy of a
        short prayer to the Virgin. M. Ratisbonne represents his own part in
        the conversations as having been of a light and chaffing order; but
        he notes the fact that for some days he was unable to banish the
        words of the prayer from his mind, and that the night before the
        crisis he had a sort of nightmare, in the imagery of which a black
        cross with no Christ upon it figured. Nevertheless, until noon of the
        next day he was free in mind and spent the time in trivial
        conversations. I now give his own words.</p>

          for a drive, but first asked me to wait for a few minutes whilst he
          attended to some duty at the church of San Andrea delle Fratte.
          Instead of waiting in the carriage, I entered the church myself to
          look at it. The church of San Andrea was poor, small, and</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg225"/><span style="font-size: 90%">empty; I believe that I found myself there almost
          alone. No work of art attracted my attention; and I passed my eyes
          mechanically over its interior without being arrested by any
          particular thought. I can only remember an entirely black dog which
          went trotting and turning before me as I mused. In an instant the
          dog had disappeared, the whole church had vanished, I no longer saw
          anything, ... or more truly I saw, O my God, one thing

          one upon the other. But finally I took the medal which I had on my
          breast, and with all the effusion of my soul I kissed the image of
          the Virgin, radiant with grace, which it bore. Oh, indeed, it was

          happened. But I felt something solemn and sacred within me which
          made me ask for a priest. I was led to one; and there, alone, after
          he had given me the positive order, I spoke as best I could,
          kneeling, and with my heart still trembling. I could give no
          account to myself of the truth of which I had acquired a knowledge

          saw the extreme of misery from which I had been saved by an
          infinite mercy; and I shuddered at the sight of my iniquities,
          stupefied, melted, overwhelmed with wonder and with gratitude. You
          may ask me how I came to this new insight, for truly I had never
          opened a book of religion nor even read a single page of the Bible,
          and the dogma of original sin is either entirely denied or
          forgotten by the Hebrews of to-day, so that I had thought so little
          about it that I doubt whether I ever knew its name. But how came I,
          then, to this perception of it? I can answer nothing save this,
          that on entering that church I was in darkness altogether, and on
          coming out of it I saw the fullness of the light. I can explain the
          change no better than by the simile of a profound sleep or the
          analogy of one born blind who should suddenly open his eyes to the
          day. He sees, but cannot define the light which bathes him and by
          means of which he sees the objects which excite his wonder. If we
          cannot explain physical light, how can we explain the light which
          is the truth itself? And I think I remain within the limits of
          veracity when I say that without having any knowledge of the letter
          of religious doctrine, I now intuitively perceived its sense and
          spirit. Better than if I saw them, I</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">felt</span></em> <span style="font-size: 90%">those hidden things; I felt them by the
          inexplicable effects they produced in me. It all happened in my
          interior mind; and those impressions, more rapid than thought,
          shook my soul, revolved and turned it, as it were, in another
          direction, towards other aims, by other paths. I express myself
          badly. But do you wish, Lord, that I should inclose in poor and
          barren words sentiments which the heart alone can
          understand?</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I might multiply
        cases almost indefinitely, but these will suffice to show you how
        real, definite, and memorable an event a sudden conversion may be to
        him who has the experience. Throughout the height of it he
        undoubtedly seems to himself a passive spectator or undergoer of an
        astounding process performed upon him from above. There is too much
        evidence of this for any doubt of it to be possible. Theology,
        combining this fact with the doctrines of election and grace, has
        concluded that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg
        227]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg227"/> the
        spirit of God is with us at these dramatic moments in a peculiarly
        miraculous way, unlike what happens at any other juncture of our
        lives. At that moment, it believes, an absolutely new nature is
        breathed into us, and we become partakers of the very substance of
        the Deity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the
        conversion should be instantaneous seems called for on this view, and
        the Moravian Protestants appear to have been the first to see this

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this while the
        more usual sects of Protestantism have set no such store by
        instantaneous conversion. For them as for the Catholic Church,
        Christ's blood, the sacraments, and the individual's ordinary
        religious duties are practically supposed to suffice to his
        salvation, even though no acute crisis of self-despair and surrender
        followed by relief should be experienced. For Methodism, on the
        contrary, unless there have been a crisis of this sort, salvation is
        only offered, not effectively received, and Christ's sacrifice in so
        far forth is incomplete. Methodism surely here follows, if not the
        healthier-minded, yet on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg

        it has set up as typical and worthy of imitation are not only the

        more complete.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the fully
        evolved Revivalism of Great Britain and America we have, so to speak,
        the codified and stereotyped procedure to which this way of thinking
        has led. In spite of the unquestionable fact that saints of the
        once-born type exist, that there may be a gradual growth in holiness
        without a cataclysm; in spite of the obvious leakage (as one may say)
        of much mere natural goodness into the scheme of salvation;
        revivalism has always assumed that only its own type of religious
        experience can be perfect; you must first be nailed on the cross of
        natural despair and agony, and then in the twinkling of an eye be
        miraculously released.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is natural that
        those who personally have traversed such an experience should carry
        away a feeling of its being a miracle rather than a natural process.
        Voices are often heard, lights seen, or visions witnessed; automatic
        motor phenomena occur; and it always seems, after the surrender of
        the personal will, as if an extraneous higher power had flooded in
        and taken possession. Moreover the sense of renovation, safety,
        cleanness, rightness, can be so marvelous and jubilant as well to

<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What, now, must we
        ourselves think of this question? Is an instantaneous conversion a
        miracle in which God is present as he is present in no change of
        heart less strikingly abrupt? Are there two classes of human beings,
        even among the apparently regenerate, of which the one class really
        partakes of Christ's nature while the other merely seems to do so?
        Or, on the contrary, may the whole phenomenon of regeneration, even
        in these startling instantaneous examples, possibly be a strictly
        natural process, divine in its fruits, of course, but in one case
        more and in another less so, and neither more nor less divine in its
        mere causation and mechanism than any other process, high or low, of
        man's interior life?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before proceeding
        to answer this question, I must ask you to listen to some more
        psychological remarks. At our last lecture, I explained the shifting
        of men's centres of personal energy within them and the lighting up
        of new crises of emotion. I explained the phenomena as partly due to
        explicitly conscious processes of thought and will, but as due
        largely also to the subconscious incubation and maturing of motives
        deposited by the experiences of life. When ripe, the results hatch
        out, or burst into flower. I have now to speak of the subconscious
        region, in which such processes of flowering may occur, in a somewhat
        less vague way. I only regret that my limits of time here force me to
        be so short.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg
        231]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg231"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The expression
        <span class="tei tei-q">“field of consciousness”</span> has but
        recently come into vogue in the psychology books. Until quite lately
        the unit of mental life which figured most was the single
        <span class="tei tei-q">“idea”</span> supposed to be a definitely
        outlined thing. But at present psychologists are tending, first, to
        admit that the actual unit is more probably the total mental state,
        the entire wave of consciousness or field of objects present to the
        thought at any time; and, second, to see that it is impossible to
        outline this wave, this field, with any definiteness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As our mental
        fields succeed one another, each has its centre of interest, around
        which the objects of which we are less and less attentively conscious
        fade to a margin so faint that its limits are unassignable. Some
        fields are narrow fields and some are wide fields. Usually when we
        have a wide field we rejoice, for we then see masses of truth
        together, and often get glimpses of relations which we divine rather
        than see, for they shoot beyond the field into still remoter regions
        of objectivity, regions which we seem rather to be about to perceive
        than to perceive actually. At other times, of drowsiness, illness, or
        fatigue, our fields may narrow almost to a point, and we find
        ourselves correspondingly oppressed and contracted.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Different
        individuals present constitutional differences in this matter of
        width of field. Your great organizing geniuses are men with
        habitually vast fields of mental vision, in which a whole programme
        of future operations will appear dotted out at once, the rays
        shooting far ahead into definite directions of advance. In common
        people there is never this magnificent inclusive view of a topic.
        They stumble along, feeling their way, as it were, from point to
        point, and often stop entirely. In certain diseased conditions
        consciousness is a mere spark, without memory of the past or thought
        of the future, and with the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg
        232]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg232"/>
        present narrowed down to some one simple emotion or sensation of the
        body.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The important fact
        which this <span class="tei tei-q">“field”</span> formula
        commemorates is the indetermination of the margin. Inattentively
        realized as is the matter which the margin contains, it is
        nevertheless there, and helps both to guide our behavior and to
        determine the next movement of our attention. It lies around us like
        a <span class="tei tei-q">“magnetic field,”</span> inside of which
        our centre of energy turns like a compass-needle, as the present
        phase of consciousness alters into its successor. Our whole past
        store of memories floats beyond this margin, ready at a touch to come
        in; and the entire mass of residual powers, impulses, and knowledges
        that constitute our empirical self stretches continuously beyond it.
        So vaguely drawn are the outlines between what is actual and what is
        only potential at any moment of our conscious life, that it is always
        hard to say of certain mental elements whether we are conscious of
        them or not.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ordinary
        psychology, admitting fully the difficulty of tracing the marginal
        outline, has nevertheless taken for granted, first, that all the
        consciousness the person now has, be the same focal or marginal,
        inattentive or attentive, is there in the <span class="tei tei-q">“field”</span> of the moment, all dim and impossible to
        assign as the latter's outline may be; and, second, that what is
        absolutely extra-marginal is absolutely non-existent, and cannot be a
        fact of consciousness at all.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And having reached
        this point, I must now ask you to recall what I said in my last
        lecture about the subconscious life. I said, as you may recollect,
        that those who first laid stress upon these phenomena could not know
        the facts as we now know them. My first duty now is to tell you what
        I meant by such a statement.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg233"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I cannot but think
        that the most important step forward that has occurred in psychology
        since I have been a student of that science is the discovery, first
        made in 1886, that, in certain subjects at least, there is not only
        the consciousness of the ordinary field, with its usual centre and
        margin, but an addition thereto in the shape of a set of memories,
        thoughts, and feelings which are extra-marginal and outside of the
        primary consciousness altogether, but yet must be classed as
        conscious facts of some sort, able to reveal their presence by
        unmistakable signs. I call this the most important step forward
        because, unlike the other advances which psychology has made, this
        discovery has revealed to us an entirely unsuspected peculiarity in
        the constitution of human nature. No other step forward which
        psychology has made can proffer any such claim as this.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In particular this
        discovery of a consciousness existing beyond the field, or
        subliminally as Mr. Myers terms it, casts light on many phenomena of
        religious biography. That is why I have to advert to it now, although
        it is naturally impossible for me in this place to give you any
        account of the evidence on which the admission of such a
        consciousness is based. You will find it set forth in many recent
        books, Binet's Alterations of Personality<a href="#note_122" id="noteref_122" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">122</span></span></a> being
        perhaps as good a one as any to recommend.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The human material
        on which the demonstration has been made has so far been rather
        limited and, in part at least, eccentric, consisting of unusually
        suggestible hypnotic subjects, and of hysteric patients. Yet the
        elementary mechanisms of our life are presumably so uniform that what
        is shown to be true in a marked degree of some persons is probably
        true in some degree of all, and may in a few be true in an
        extraordinarily high degree.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg234"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most important
        consequence of having a strongly developed ultra-marginal life of
        this sort is that one's ordinary fields of consciousness are liable
        to incursions from it of which the subject does not guess the source,
        and which, therefore, take for him the form of unaccountable impulses
        to act, or inhibitions of action, of obsessive ideas, or even of
        hallucinations of sight or hearing. The impulses may take the
        direction of automatic speech or writing, the meaning of which the
        subject himself may not understand even while he utters it; and
        generalizing this phenomenon, Mr. Myers has given the name of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">automatism</span></em>, sensory or motor,
        emotional or intellectual, to this whole sphere of effects, due to
        <span class="tei tei-q">“uprushes”</span> into the ordinary
        consciousness of energies originating in the subliminal parts of the
        mind.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The simplest
        instance of an automatism is the phenomenon of post-hypnotic
        suggestion, so-called. You give to a hypnotized subject, adequately
        susceptible, an order to perform some designated act—usual or
        eccentric, it makes no difference—after he wakes from his hypnotic
        sleep. Punctually, when the signal comes or the time elapses upon
        which you have told him that the act must ensue, he performs it;—but
        in so doing he has no recollection of your suggestion, and he always
        trumps up an improvised pretext for his behavior if the act be of an
        eccentric kind. It may even be suggested to a subject to have a
        vision or to hear a voice at a certain interval after waking, and
        when the time comes the vision is seen or the voice heard, with no
        inkling on the subject's part of its source. In the wonderful
        explorations by Binet, Janet, Breuer, Freud, Mason, Prince, and
        others, of the subliminal consciousness of patients with hysteria, we
        have revealed to us whole systems of underground life, in the shape
        of memories of a painful sort which lead a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg235"/> parasitic existence, buried outside of the
        primary fields of consciousness, and making irruptions thereinto with
        hallucinations, pains, convulsions, paralyses of feeling and of
        motion, and the whole procession of symptoms of hysteric disease of
        body and of mind. Alter or abolish by suggestion these subconscious
        memories, and the patient immediately gets well. His symptoms were
        automatisms, in Mr. Myers's sense of the word. These clinical records
        sound like fairy-tales when one first reads them, yet it is
        impossible to doubt their accuracy; and, the path having been once
        opened by these first observers, similar observations have been made
        elsewhere. They throw, as I said, a wholly new light upon our natural
        constitution.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And it seems to me
        that they make a farther step inevitable. Interpreting the unknown
        after the analogy of the known, it seems to me that hereafter,
        wherever we meet with a phenomenon of automatism, be it motor
        impulses, or obsessive idea, or unaccountable caprice, or delusion,
        or hallucination, we are bound first of all to make search whether it
        be not an explosion, into the fields of ordinary consciousness, of
        ideas elaborated outside of those fields in subliminal regions of the
        mind. We should look, therefore, for its source in the Subject's
        subconscious life. In the hypnotic cases, we ourselves create the
        source by our suggestion, so we know it directly. In the hysteric
        cases, the lost memories which are the source have to be extracted
        from the patient's Subliminal by a number of ingenious methods, for
        an account of which you must consult the books. In other pathological
        cases, insane delusions, for example, or psychopathic obsessions, the
        source is yet to seek, but by analogy it also should be in subliminal
        regions which improvements in our methods may yet conceivably put on
        tap. There lies the mechanism logically to be assumed,—but the
        assumption <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg
        236]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg236"/>
        involves a vast program of work to be done in the way of
        verification, in which the religious experiences of man must play
        their part.<a href="#note_123" id="noteref_123" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">123</span></span></a></p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And thus I return
        to our own specific subject of instantaneous conversions. You
        remember the cases of Alline, Bradley, Brainerd, and the graduate of
        Oxford converted at three in the afternoon. Similar occurrences
        abound, some with and some without luminous visions, all with a sense
        of astonished happiness, and of being wrought on by a higher control.
        If, abstracting altogether from the question of their value for the
        future spiritual life of the individual, we take them on their
        psychological <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg
        237]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg237"/>
        side exclusively, so many peculiarities in them remind us of what we
        find outside of conversion that we are tempted to class them along
        with other automatisms, and to suspect that what makes the difference
        between a sudden and a gradual convert is not necessarily the
        presence of divine miracle in the case of one and of something less
        divine in that of the other, but rather a simple psychological
        peculiarity, the fact, namely, that in the recipient of the more
        instantaneous grace we have one of those Subjects who are in
        possession of a large region in which mental work can go on
        subliminally, and from which invasive experiences, abruptly upsetting
        the equilibrium of the primary consciousness, may come.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I do not see why
        Methodists need object to such a view. Pray go back and recollect one
        of the conclusions to which I sought to lead you in my very first
        lecture. You may remember how I there argued against the notion that
        the worth of a thing can be decided by its origin. Our spiritual
        judgment, I said, our opinion of the significance and value of a
        human event or condition, must be decided on empirical grounds
        exclusively. If the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fruits for life</span></em> of the state of
        conversion are good, we ought to idealize and venerate it, even
        though it be a piece of natural psychology; if not, we ought to make
        short work with it, no matter what supernatural being may have
        infused it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Well, how is it
        with these fruits? If we except the class of preëminent saints of
        whom the names illumine history, and consider only the usual run of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“saints,”</span> the shopkeeping
        church-members and ordinary youthful or middle-aged recipients of
        instantaneous conversion, whether at revivals or in the spontaneous
        course of methodistic growth, you will probably agree that no
        splendor worthy of a wholly supernatural creature fulgurates from
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg238"/> them, or sets them apart from
        the mortals who have never experienced that favor. Were it true that
        a suddenly converted man as such is, as Edwards says,<a href="#note_124" id="noteref_124" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a> of an
        entirely different kind from a natural man, partaking as he does
        directly of Christ's substance, there surely ought to be some
        exquisite class-mark, some distinctive radiance attaching even to the
        lowliest specimen of this genus, to which no one of us could remain
        insensible, and which, so far as it went, would prove him more
        excellent than ever the most highly gifted among mere natural men.
        But notoriously there is no such radiance. Converted men as a class
        are indistinguishable from natural men; some natural men even excel
        some converted men in their fruits; and no one ignorant of doctrinal
        theology could guess by mere every-day inspection of the <span class="tei tei-q">“accidents”</span> of the two groups of persons before
        him, that their substance differed as much as divine differs from
        human substance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The believers in
        the non-natural character of sudden conversion have had practically
        to admit that there is no unmistakable class-mark distinctive of all
        true converts. The super-normal incidents, such as voices and visions
        and overpowering impressions of the meaning of suddenly presented
        scripture texts, the melting emotions and tumultuous affections
        connected with the crisis of change, may all come by way of nature,
        or worse still, be counterfeited by Satan. The real witness of the
        spirit to the second birth is to be found only in the disposition of
        the genuine child of God, the permanently patient heart, the love of
        self eradicated. And this, it has to be admitted, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg239"/> is also found in those who pass no
        crisis, and may even be found outside of Christianity altogether.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Throughout
        Jonathan Edwards's admirably rich and delicate description of the
        supernaturally infused condition, in his Treatise on Religious
        Affections, there is not one decisive trait, not one mark, that
        unmistakably parts it off from what may possibly be only an
        exceptionally high degree of natural goodness. In fact, one could
        hardly read a clearer argument than this book unwittingly offers in
        favor of the thesis that no chasm exists between the orders of human
        excellence, but that here as elsewhere, nature shows continuous
        differences, and generation and regeneration are matters of
        degree.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All which denial
        of two objective classes of human beings separated by a chasm must
        not leave us blind to the extraordinary momentousness of the fact of
        his conversion to the individual himself who gets converted. There
        are higher and lower limits of possibility set to each personal life.
        If a flood but goes above one's head, its absolute elevation becomes
        a matter of small importance; and when we touch our own upper limit
        and live in our own highest centre of energy, we may call ourselves
        saved, no matter how much higher some one else's centre may be. A
        small man's salvation will always be a great salvation and the
        greatest of all facts <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for him</span></em>, and we should remember this
        when the fruits of our ordinary evangelicism look discouraging. Who
        knows how much less ideal still the lives of these spiritual grubs
        and earthworms, these Crumps and Stigginses, might have been, if such
        poor grace as they have received had never touched them at all?<a href="#note_125" id="noteref_125" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">125</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg240"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we roughly
        arrange human beings in classes, each class standing for a grade of
        spiritual excellence, I believe we shall find natural men and
        converts both sudden and gradual in all the classes. The forms which
        regenerative change effects have, then, no general spiritual
        significance, but only a psychological significance. We have seen how
        Starbuck's laborious statistical studies tend to assimilate
        conversion to ordinary spiritual growth. Another American
        psychologist, Prof. George A. Coe,<a href="#note_126" id="noteref_126" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">126</span></span></a> has
        analyzed the cases of seventy-seven converts or ex-candidates for
        conversion, known to him, and the results strikingly confirm the view
        that sudden conversion is connected with the possession of an active
        subliminal self. Examining his subjects with reference to their
        hypnotic sensibility and to such automatisms as hypnagogic
        hallucinations, odd impulses, religious dreams about the time of
        their conversion, etc., he found these relatively much more frequent
        in the group of converts whose transformation had been <span class="tei tei-q">“striking,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“striking”</span> transformation being defined as a
        change which, though not necessarily instantaneous, seems to the
        subject of it to be distinctly different from a process of growth,
        however rapid.<a href="#note_127" id="noteref_127" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a>
        Candidates for conversion at revivals are, as you know, often
        disappointed: they experience nothing striking. Professor Coe had a
        number of persons of this class among his seventy-seven subjects, and
        they almost all, when tested by hypnotism, proved to belong to a
        subclass which he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg
        241]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg241"/>
        calls <span class="tei tei-q">“spontaneous,”</span> that is, fertile
        in self-suggestions, as distinguished from a <span class="tei tei-q">“passive”</span> subclass, to which most of the subjects
        of striking transformation belonged. His inference is that
        self-suggestion of impossibility had prevented the influence upon
        these persons of an environment which, on the more <span class="tei tei-q">“passive”</span> subjects, had easily brought forth the
        effects they looked for. Sharp distinctions are difficult in these
        regions, and Professor Coe's numbers are small. But his methods were
        careful, and the results tally with what one might expect; and they
        seem, on the whole, to justify his practical conclusion, which is
        that if you should expose to a converting influence a subject in whom
        three factors unite: first, pronounced emotional sensibility; second,
        tendency to automatisms; and third, suggestibility of the passive
        type; you might then safely predict the result: there would be a
        sudden conversion, a transformation of the striking kind.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Does this
        temperamental origin diminish the significance of the sudden
        conversion when it has occurred? Not in the least, as Professor Coe
        well says; for <span class="tei tei-q">“the ultimate test of
        religious values is nothing psychological, nothing definable in terms
        of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how it
        happens</span></em>, but something ethical, definable only in terms
        of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what is
        attained</span></em>.”</span><a href="#note_128" id="noteref_128" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">128</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As we proceed
        farther in our inquiry we shall see that what is attained is often an
        altogether new level of spiritual vitality, a relatively heroic
        level, in which impossible things have become possible, and new
        energies and endurances are shown. The personality is changed, the
        man <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> born anew, whether or not his
        psychological idiosyncrasies are what give the particular shape to
        his metamorphosis. <span class="tei tei-q">“Sanctification”</span> is
        the technical name of this result; and erelong examples of it shall
        be brought <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg
        242]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg242"/>
        before you. In this lecture I have still only to add a few remarks on
        the assurance and peace which fill the hour of change itself.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One word more,
        though, before proceeding to that point, lest the final purpose of my
        explanation of suddenness by subliminal activity be misunderstood. I
        do indeed believe that if the Subject have no liability to such
        subconscious activity, or if his conscious fields have a hard rind of
        a margin that resists incursions from beyond it, his conversion must
        be gradual if it occur, and must resemble any simple growth into new
        habits. His possession of a developed subliminal self, and of a leaky
        or pervious margin, is thus a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">conditio sine qua
        non</span></span> of the Subject's becoming converted in the
        instantaneous way. But if you, being orthodox Christians, ask me as a
        psychologist whether the reference of a phenomenon to a subliminal
        self does not exclude the notion of the direct presence of the Deity
        altogether, I have to say frankly that as a psychologist I do not see
        why it necessarily should. The lower manifestations of the
        Subliminal, indeed, fall within the resources of the personal
        subject: his ordinary sense-material, inattentively taken in and
        subconsciously remembered and combined, will account for all his
        usual automatisms. But just as our primary wide-awake consciousness
        throws open our senses to the touch of things material, so it is
        logically conceivable that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">if there be</span></em> higher spiritual
        agencies that can directly touch us, the psychological condition of
        their doing so <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">might be</span></em> our possession of a
        subconscious region which alone should yield access to them. The
        hubbub of the waking life might close a door which in the dreamy
        Subliminal might remain ajar or open.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus that
        perception of external control which is so <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg243"/> essential a feature in conversion might, in
        some cases at any rate, be interpreted as the orthodox interpret it:
        forces transcending the finite individual might impress him, on
        condition of his being what we may call a subliminal human specimen.
        But in any case the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">value</span></em> of these forces would have to
        be determined by their effects, and the mere fact of their
        transcendency would of itself establish no presumption that they were
        more divine than diabolical.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I confess that
        this is the way in which I should rather see the topic left lying in
        your minds until I come to a much later lecture, when I hope once
        more to gather these dropped threads together into more definitive
        conclusions. The notion of a subconscious self certainly ought not at
        this point of our inquiry to be held to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exclude</span></em>
        all notion of a higher penetration. If there be higher powers able to
        impress us, they may get access to us only through the subliminal
        door. (See below, p. <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Pg515">515</a>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us turn now to
        the feelings which immediately fill the hour of the conversion
        experience. The first one to be noted is just this sense of higher
        control. It is not always, but it is very often present. We saw
        examples of it in Alline, Bradley, Brainerd, and elsewhere. The need
        of such a higher controlling agency is well expressed in the short
        reference which the eminent French Protestant Adolphe Monod makes to
        the crisis of his own conversion. It was at Naples in his early
        manhood, in the summer of 1827.</p>

        It was then that I saw that to expect to put a stop to this

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">some influence from
        without</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. I remembered the
        promise of the Holy Ghost; and what the positive declarations of the
        Gospel had never succeeded in bringing home to me, I learned at last
        from necessity, and believed, for the first time in my life, in this
        promise, in the only sense in which it answered the needs of my soul,
        in that, namely, of a real external supernatural action, capable of
        giving me thoughts, and taking them away from me, and exerted on me
        by a God as truly master of my heart as he is of the rest of nature.
        Renouncing then all merit, all strength, abandoning all my personal
        resources, and acknowledging no other title to his mercy than my own
        utter misery, I went home and threw myself on my knees, and prayed as
        I never yet prayed in my life. From this day onwards a new interior
        life began for me: not that my melancholy had disappeared, but it had
        lost its sting. Hope had entered into my heart, and once entered on
        the path, the God of Jesus Christ, to whom I then had learned to give
        myself up, little by little did the rest.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_129" id="noteref_129" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">129</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is needless to
        remind you once more of the admirable congruity of Protestant
        theology with the structure of the mind as shown in such experiences.
        In the extreme of melancholy the self that consciously <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> can do
        absolutely nothing. It is completely bankrupt and without resource,
        and no works it can accomplish will avail. Redemption from such

        through Christ's accomplished sacrifice is such a gift.</p>

          own natural and proper work. Therefore God must take this maul in
          hand (the law, I mean) to beat in pieces and bring to nothing this
          beast with her vain confidence, that she may so learn at length by
          her own misery that she is utterly forlorn and damned. But here
          lieth the difficulty, that when a man is terrified and cast down,
          he is so little able to raise himself up again and say,</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Now I am
          bruised and afflicted enough; now is the time of grace; now is the
          time to hear Christ.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">The
          foolishness of man's heart is so great that then he rather seeketh
          to himself more laws to satisfy his conscience.</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">If I live,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">saith

          here, except thou do the quite contrary, except thou send Moses

          thy shaven crown, thy chastity, thy obedience, thy poverty, thy
          works, thy merits? what shall all these do? what shall the law of
          Moses avail? If I, wretched and damnable sinner, through works or
          merits could have loved the Son of God, and so come to him, what
          needed he to deliver himself for me? If I, being a wretch and
          damned sinner, could be redeemed by any other price, what needed
          the Son of God to be given? But because there was no other price,
          therefore he delivered neither sheep, ox, gold, nor silver, but
          even God himself, entirely and wholly</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">for me,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">even</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">for

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That is, the more
        literally lost you are, the more literally you are the very being

        246]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg246"/> has
        ever spoken to sick souls as straight as this message from Luther's
        personal experience. As Protestants are not all sick souls, of course
        reliance on what Luther exults in calling the dung of one's merits,
        the filthy puddle of one's own righteousness, has come to the front
        again in their religion; but the adequacy of his view of Christianity
        to the deeper parts of our human mental structure is shown by its
        wildfire contagiousness when it was a new and quickening thing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Faith that Christ
        has genuinely done his work was part of what Luther meant by faith,
        which so far is faith in a fact intellectually conceived of. But this
        is only one part of Luther's faith, the other part being far more
        vital. This other part is something not intellectual but immediate
        and intuitive, the assurance, namely, that I, this individual I, just
        as I stand, without one plea, etc., am saved now and forever.<a href="#note_131" id="noteref_131" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Professor Leuba is
        undoubtedly right in contending that the conceptual belief about
        Christ's work, although so often efficacious and antecedent, is
        really accessory and non-essential, and that the <span class="tei tei-q">“joyous conviction”</span> can also <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg247"/> come by far other channels than this
        conception. It is to the joyous conviction itself, the assurance that
        all is well with one, that he would give the name of faith

          Various dogmatic beliefs suddenly, on the advent of the
          faith-state, acquire a character of certainty, assume a new
          reality, become an object of faith. As the ground of assurance here
          is not rational, argumentation is irrelevant. But such conviction
          being a mere casual offshoot of the faith-state, it is a gross
          error to imagine that the chief practical value of the faith-state
          is its power to stamp with the seal of reality certain particular
          theological conceptions.</span><a href="#note_132" id="noteref_132" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a>
<span style="font-size: 90%">On the contrary, its value lies solely
          in the fact that it is the psychic correlate of a biological growth
          reducing contending desires to one direction; a growth which
          expresses itself in new affective states and new reactions; in
          larger, nobler, more Christ-like activities. The ground of the
          specific assurance in religious dogmas is then an affective
          experience. The objects of faith may even be preposterous; the
          affective stream will float them along, and invest them with
          unshakable certitude. The more startling the affective experience,
          the less explicable it seems, the easier it is to make it the
          carrier of unsubstantiated notions.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_133" id="noteref_133" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">133</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
        characteristics of the affective experience which, to avoid
        ambiguity, should, I think, be called the state of assurance rather
        than the faith-state, can be easily enumerated, though it is probably
        difficult to realize their <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg
        248]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg248"/>
        intensity, unless one have been through the experience one's
        self.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The central one is
        the loss of all the worry, the sense that all is ultimately well with
        one, the peace, the harmony, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">willingness to
        be</span></em>, even though the outer conditions should remain the
        same. The certainty of God's <span class="tei tei-q">“grace,”</span>
        of <span class="tei tei-q">“justification,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“salvation,”</span> is an objective belief that usually
        accompanies the change in Christians; but this may be entirely
        lacking and yet the affective peace remain the same—you will
        recollect the case of the Oxford graduate: and many might be given
        where the assurance of personal salvation was only a later result. A
        passion of willingness, of acquiescence, of admiration, is the
        glowing centre of this state of mind.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second feature
        is the sense of perceiving truths not known before. The mysteries of
        life become lucid, as Professor Leuba says; and often, nay usually,
        the solution is more or less unutterable in words. But these more
        intellectual phenomena may be postponed until we treat of
        mysticism.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A third
        peculiarity of the assurance state is the objective change which the
        world often appears to undergo. <span class="tei tei-q">“An
        appearance of newness beautifies every object,”</span> the precise
        opposite of that other sort of newness, that dreadful unreality and
        strangeness in the appearance of the world, which is experienced by
        melancholy patients, and of which you may recall my relating some
        examples.<a href="#note_134" id="noteref_134" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">134</span></span></a> This
        sense of clean and beautiful newness within and without is one of the
        commonest entries in conversion records. Jonathan Edwards thus
        describes it in himself:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em">

        increased, and became more and more lively, and had more of that
        inward sweetness. The appearance of everything was altered;
        there</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg
        249]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg249"/><span style="font-size: 90%">seemed to be, as it
        were, a calm, sweet cast, or appearance of divine glory, in almost
        everything. God's excellency, his wisdom, his purity and love, seemed
        to appear in everything; in the sun, moon, and stars; in the clouds
        and blue sky; in the grass, flowers, and trees; in the water and all
        nature; which used greatly to fix my mind. And scarce anything, among
        all the works of nature, was so sweet to me as thunder and lightning;
        formerly nothing had been so terrible to me. Before, I used to be
        uncommonly terrified with thunder, and to be struck with terror when
        I saw a thunderstorm rising; but now, on the contrary, it rejoices
        me.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_135" id="noteref_135" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">135</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Billy Bray, an
        excellent little illiterate English evangelist, records his sense of
        newness thus:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">

          that seek shall find, and to them that knock the door shall be
          opened, and I have faith to believe it.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">In an
          instant the Lord made me so happy that I cannot express what I
          felt. I shouted for joy. I praised God with my whole heart.... I
          think this was in November, 1823, but what day of the month I do
          not know. I remember this, that everything looked new to me, the
          people, the fields, the cattle, the trees. I was like a new man in
          a new world. I spent the greater part of my time in praising the
          Lord.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_136" id="noteref_136" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Starbuck and Leuba
        both illustrate this sense of newness by quotations. I take the two
        following from Starbuck's manuscript collection. One, a woman,
        says:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I was taken to a camp-meeting, mother and religious
        friends seeking and praying for my conversion. My emotional nature
        was stirred to its depths; confessions of depravity and pleading with
        God for salvation from sin made me oblivious of all surroundings. I
        plead for mercy, and had a vivid realization of forgiveness and
        renewal of my nature. When rising from my knees I exclaimed,</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Old things have
        passed away, all things</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">

          new.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">It was like entering another world, a
          new state of existence. Natural objects were glorified, my
          spiritual vision was so clarified that I saw beauty in every
          material object in the universe, the woods were vocal with heavenly
          music; my soul exulted in the love of God, and I wanted everybody
          to share in my joy.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next case is
        that of a man:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I know not how I got back into the encampment, but
        found myself staggering up to Rev. ——'s Holiness tent—and as it was
        full of seekers and a terrible noise inside, some groaning, some
        laughing, and some shouting, and by a large oak, ten feet from the
        tent, I fell on my face by a bench, and tried to pray, and every time
        I would call on God, something like a man's hand would strangle me by
        choking. I don't know whether there were any one around or near me or
        not. I thought I should surely die if I did not get help, but just as
        often as I would pray, that unseen hand was felt on my throat and my
        breath squeezed off. Finally something said:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Venture on the atonement, for you will die anyway if
        you don't.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">So I made one final struggle to call on
        God for mercy, with the same choking and strangling, determined to
        finish the sentence of prayer for Mercy, if I did strangle and die,
        and the last I remember that time was falling back on the ground with
        the same unseen hand on my throat. I don't know how long I lay there
        or what was going on. None of my folks were present. When I came to
        myself, there were a crowd around me praising God. The very heavens
        seemed to open and pour down rays of light and glory. Not for a
        moment only, but all day and night, floods of light and glory seemed
        to pour through my soul, and oh, how I was changed, and everything
        became new. My horses and hogs and even everybody seemed
        changed.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This man's case
        introduces the feature of automatisms, which in suggestible subjects
        have been so startling a feature at revivals since, in Edwards's,
        Wesley's, and Whitfield's time, these became a regular means of
        gospel propagation. They were at first supposed to be semi-miraculous
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg251"/> proofs of <span class="tei tei-q">“power”</span> on the part of the Holy Ghost; but great
        divergence of opinion quickly arose concerning them. Edwards, in his
        Thoughts on the Revival of Religion in New England, has to defend
        them against their critics; and their value has long been matter of
        debate even within the revivalistic denominations.<a href="#note_137" id="noteref_137" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a> They
        undoubtedly have no essential spiritual significance, and although
        their presence makes his conversion more memorable to the convert, it
        has never been proved that converts who show them are more
        persevering or fertile in good fruits than those whose change of
        heart has had less violent accompaniments. On the whole,
        unconsciousness, convulsions, visions, involuntary vocal utterances,
        and suffocation, must be simply ascribed to the subject's having a
        large subliminal region, involving nervous instability. This is often
        the subject's own view of the matter afterwards. One of Starbuck's
        correspondents writes, for instance:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I have been through the experience which is known as
        conversion. My explanation of it is this: the subject works his
        emotions up to the breaking point, at the same time resisting their
        physical manifestations, such as quickened pulse, etc., and then
        suddenly lets them have their full sway over his body. The relief is
        something wonderful, and the pleasurable effects of the emotions are
        experienced to the highest degree.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is one form
        of sensory automatism which possibly deserves special notice on
        account of its frequency. I refer to hallucinatory or
        pseudo-hallucinatory luminous phenomena, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">photisms</span></em>,
        to use the term of the psychologists. Saint Paul's blinding heavenly
        vision seems to have been a phenomenon of this sort; so does
        Constantine's <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg
        252]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg252"/>
        cross in the sky. The last case but one which I quoted mentions
        floods of light and glory. Henry Alline mentions a light, about whose
        externality he seems uncertain. Colonel Gardiner sees a blazing
        light. President Finney writes:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">

        about me in a manner almost marvelous.... A light perfectly ineffable
        shone in my soul, that almost prostrated me on the ground.... This
        light seemed like the brightness of the sun in every direction. It
        was too intense for the eyes.... I think I knew something then, by

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such reports of
        photisms are indeed far from uncommon. Here is another from
        Starbuck's collection, where the light appeared evidently
        external:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I had attended a series of revival services for
        about two weeks off and on. Had been invited to the altar several
        times, all the time becoming more deeply impressed, when finally I
        decided I must do this, or I should be lost. Realization of
        conversion was very vivid, like a ton's weight being lifted from my
        heart; a strange light which seemed to light up the whole room (for
        it was dark); a conscious supreme bliss which caused me to
        repeat</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Glory to
        God</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">for a long time. Decided to be God's child for life,
        and to give up my pet ambition, wealth and social position. My former
        habits of life hindered my growth somewhat, but I set about
        overcoming these systematically, and in one year my whole nature was
        changed, i.e., my ambitions were of a different
        order.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here is another
        one of Starbuck's cases, involving a luminous element:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">

        before, or rather reclaimed. My experience in regeneration was then
        clear and spiritual, and I had not backslidden. But I
        experienced</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg
        253]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg253"/><span style="font-size: 90%">entire
        sanctification on the 15th day of March, 1893, about eleven o'clock
        in the morning. The particular accompaniments of the experience were
        entirely unexpected. I was quietly sitting at home singing selections
        out of Pentecostal Hymns. Suddenly there seemed to be a something
        sweeping into me and inflating my entire being—such a sensation as I
        had never experienced before. When this experience came, I seemed to
        be conducted around a large, capacious, well-lighted room. As I
        walked with my invisible conductor and looked around, a clear thought
        was coined in my mind,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">They are not
        here, they are gone.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">As soon
        as the thought was definitely formed in my mind, though no word was
        spoken, the Holy Spirit impressed me that I was surveying my own
        soul. Then, for the first time in all my life, did I know that I was
        cleansed from all sin, and filled with the fullness of
        God.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most
        characteristic of all the elements of the conversion crisis, and the
        last one of which I shall speak, is the ecstasy of happiness
        produced. We have already heard several accounts of it, but I will
        add a couple more. President Finney's is so vivid that I give it at
        length:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">

        utterance of my heart was,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I want to pour my whole soul out to
          God.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">The rising of my soul was so great
          that I rushed into the back room of the front office, to pray.
          There was no fire and no light in the room; nevertheless it
          appeared to me as if it were perfectly light. As I went in and shut
          the door after me, it seemed as if I met the Lord Jesus Christ face
          to face. It did not occur to me then, nor did it for some time
          afterwards, that it was wholly a mental state. On the contrary, it
          seemed to me that I saw him as I would see any other man. He said
          nothing, but looked at me in such a manner as to break me</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg255"/><span style="font-size: 90%">right down at his feet. I have always since
          regarded this as a most remarkable state of mind; for it seemed to
          me a reality that he stood before me, and I fell down at his feet
          and poured out my soul to him. I wept aloud like a child, and made
          such confessions as I could with my choked utterance. It seemed to
          me that I bathed his feet with my tears; and yet I had no distinct
          impression that I touched him, that I recollect. I must have
          continued in this state for a good while; but my mind was too much
          absorbed with the interview to recollect anything that I said. But
          I know, as soon as my mind became calm enough to break off from the
          interview, I returned to the front office, and found that the fire
          that I had made of large wood was nearly burned out. But as I
          turned and was about to take a seat by the fire, I received a
          mighty baptism of the Holy Ghost. Without any expectation of it,
          without ever having the thought in my mind that there was any such
          thing for me, without any recollection that I had ever heard the
          thing mentioned by any person in the world, the Holy Spirit
          descended upon me in a manner that seemed to go through me, body
          and soul. I could feel the impression, like a wave of electricity,
          going through and through me. Indeed, it seemed to come in waves
          and waves of liquid love; for I could not express it in any other
          way. It seemed like the very breath of God. I can recollect
          distinctly that it seemed to fan me, like immense
          wings.</span></span></p>

          shed abroad in my heart. I wept aloud with joy and love; and I do
          not know but I should say I literally bellowed out the unutterable
          gushings of my heart. These waves came over me, and over me, and
          over me, one after the other, until I recollect I cried out,</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I shall die
          if these waves continue to pass over me.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">I

          choir—for I was the leader of the choir—came into the office to see
          me. He was a member of the church. He found me</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg256"/><span style="font-size: 90%">in this

          pain?</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One word, before I
        close this lecture, on the question of the transiency or permanence
        of these abrupt conversions. Some of you, I feel sure, knowing that
        numerous <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg
        257]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg257"/>
        backslidings and relapses take place, make of these their
        apperceiving mass for interpreting the whole subject, and dismiss it
        with a pitying smile at so much <span class="tei tei-q">“hysterics.”</span> Psychologically, as well as
        religiously, however, this is shallow. It misses the point of serious
        interest, which is not so much the duration as the nature and quality
        of these shiftings of character to higher levels. Men lapse from
        every level—we need no statistics to tell us that. Love is, for
        instance, well known not to be irrevocable, yet, constant or
        inconstant, it reveals new flights and reaches of ideality while it
        lasts. These revelations form its significance to men and women,
        whatever be its duration. So with the conversion experience: that it
        should for even a short time show a human being what the high-water
        mark of his spiritual capacity is, this is what constitutes its
        importance,—an importance which backsliding cannot diminish, although
        persistence might increase it. As a matter of fact, all the more
        striking instances of conversion, all those, for instance, which I
        have quoted, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have</span></em> been permanent. The case of
        which there might be most doubt, on account of its suggesting so
        strongly an epileptoid seizure, was the case of M. Ratisbonne. Yet I
        am informed that Ratisbonne's whole future was shaped by those few
        minutes. He gave up his project of marriage, became a priest, founded
        at Jerusalem, where he went to dwell, a mission of nuns for the
        conversion of the Jews, showed no tendency to use for egotistic
        purposes the notoriety given him by the peculiar circumstances of his
        conversion,—which, for the rest, he could seldom refer to without
        tears,—and in short remained an exemplary son of the Church until he
        died, late in the 80's, if I remember rightly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The only
        statistics I know of, on the subject of the duration of conversions,
        are those collected for Professor <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg258"/> Starbuck by Miss Johnston. They embrace only a
        hundred persons, evangelical church-members, more than half being
        Methodists. According to the statement of the subjects themselves,
        there had been backsliding of some sort in nearly all the cases, 93
        per cent. of the women, 77 per cent. of the men. Discussing the
        returns more minutely, Starbuck finds that only 6 per cent. are
        relapses from the religious faith which the conversion confirmed, and
        that the backsliding complained of is in most only a fluctuation in
        the ardor of sentiment. Only six of the hundred cases report a change
        of faith. Starbuck's conclusion is that the effect of conversion is
        to bring with it <span class="tei tei-q">“a changed attitude towards
        life, which is fairly constant and permanent, although the feelings
        fluctuate.... In other words, the persons who have passed through
        conversion, having once taken a stand for the religious life, tend to
        feel themselves identified with it, no matter how much their
        religious enthusiasm declines.”</span><a href="#note_141" id="noteref_141" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">141</span></span></a></p>

        Saintliness.</span></h1>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last lecture
        left us in a state of expectancy. What may the practical fruits for
        life have been, of such movingly happy conversions as those we heard
        of? With this question the really important part of our task opens,
        for you remember that we began all this empirical inquiry not merely
        to open a curious chapter in the natural history of human
        consciousness, but rather to attain a spiritual judgment as to the
        total value and positive meaning of all the religious trouble and
        happiness which we have seen. We must, therefore, first describe the
        fruits of the religious life, and then we must judge them. This
        divides our inquiry into two distinct parts. Let us without further
        preamble proceed to the descriptive task.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It ought to be the
        pleasantest portion of our business in these lectures. Some small
        pieces of it, it is true, may be painful, or may show human nature in
        a pathetic light, but it will be mainly pleasant, because the best
        fruits of religious experience are the best things that history has
        to show. They have always been esteemed so; here if anywhere is the
        genuinely strenuous life; and to call to mind a succession of such
        examples as I have lately had to wander through, though it has been
        only in the reading of them, is to feel encouraged and uplifted and
        washed in better moral air.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The highest
        flights of charity, devotion, trust, patience, bravery to which the
        wings of human nature have spread <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg260"/> themselves have been flown for religious
        ideals. I can do no better than quote, as to this, some remarks which
        Sainte-Beuve in his History of Port-Royal makes on the results of
        conversion or the state of grace.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Even from the purely human point of view,”</span>
        Sainte-Beuve says, <span class="tei tei-q">“the phenomenon of grace
        must still appear sufficiently extraordinary, eminent, and rare, both
        in its nature and in its effects, to deserve a closer study. For the
        soul arrives thereby at a certain fixed and invincible state, a state
        which is genuinely heroic, and from out of which the greatest deeds
        which it ever performs are executed. Through all the different forms
        of communion, and all the diversity of the means which help to
        produce this state, whether it be reached by a jubilee, by a general
        confession, by a solitary prayer and effusion, whatever in short be
        the place and the occasion, it is easy to recognize that it is
        fundamentally one state in spirit and in fruits. Penetrate a little
        beneath the diversity of circumstances, and it becomes evident that
        in Christians of different epochs it is always one and the same
        modification by which they are affected: there is veritably a single
        fundamental and identical spirit of piety and charity, common to
        those who have received grace; an inner state which before all things
        is one of love and humility, of infinite confidence in God, and of
        severity for one's self, accompanied with tenderness for others. The
        fruits peculiar to this condition of the soul have the same savor in
        all, under distant suns and in different surroundings, in Saint
        Teresa of Avila just as in any Moravian brother of
        Herrnhut.”</span><a href="#note_142" id="noteref_142" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sainte-Beuve has
        here only the more eminent instances of regeneration in mind, and
        these are of course the instructive ones for us also to consider.
        These devotees <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg
        261]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg261"/>
        have often laid their course so differently from other men that,
        judging them by worldly law, we might be tempted to call them
        monstrous aberrations from the path of nature. I begin, therefore, by
        asking a general psychological question as to what the inner
        conditions are which may make one human character differ so extremely
        from another.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I reply at once
        that where the character, as something distinguished from the
        intellect, is concerned, the causes of human diversity lie chiefly in
        our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">differing susceptibilities of emotional
        excitement</span></em>, and in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">different impulses
        and inhibitions</span></em> which these bring in their train. Let me
        make this more clear.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Speaking
        generally, our moral and practical attitude, at any given time, is
        always a resultant of two sets of forces within us, impulses pushing
        us one way and obstructions and inhibitions holding us back.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes! yes!”</span> say the impulses;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“No! no!”</span> say the inhibitions. Few
        people who have not expressly reflected on the matter realize how
        constantly this factor of inhibition is upon us, how it contains and
        moulds us by its restrictive pressure almost as if we were fluids
        pent within the cavity of a jar. The influence is so incessant that
        it becomes subconscious. All of you, for example, sit here with a
        certain constraint at this moment, and entirely without express
        consciousness of the fact, because of the influence of the occasion.
        If left alone in the room, each of you would probably involuntarily
        rearrange himself, and make his attitude more <span class="tei tei-q">“free and easy.”</span> But proprieties and their
        inhibitions snap like cobwebs if any great emotional excitement
        supervenes. I have seen a dandy appear in the street with his face
        covered with shaving-lather because a house across the way was on
        fire; and a woman will run among strangers in her nightgown if
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg262"/> it be a question of saving her
        baby's life or her own. Take a self-indulgent woman's life in
        general. She will yield to every inhibition set by her disagreeable
        sensations, lie late in bed, live upon tea or bromides, keep indoors
        from the cold. Every difficulty finds her obedient to its
        <span class="tei tei-q">“no.”</span> But make a mother of her, and
        what have you? Possessed by maternal excitement, she now confronts
        wakefulness, weariness, and toil without an instant of hesitation or
        a word of complaint. The inhibitive power of pain over her is
        extinguished wherever the baby's interests are at stake. The
        inconveniences which this creature occasions have become, as James
        Hinton says, the glowing heart of a great joy, and indeed are now the
        very conditions whereby the joy becomes most deep.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is an example
        of what you have already heard of as the <span class="tei tei-q">“expulsive power of a higher affection.”</span> But be
        the affection high or low, it makes no difference, so long as the
        excitement it brings be strong enough. In one of Henry Drummond's
        discourses he tells of an inundation in India where an eminence with
        a bungalow upon it remained unsubmerged, and became the refuge of a
        number of wild animals and reptiles in addition to the human beings
        who were there. At a certain moment a royal Bengal tiger appeared
        swimming towards it, reached it, and lay panting like a dog upon the
        ground in the midst of the people, still possessed by such an agony
        of terror that one of the Englishmen could calmly step up with a
        rifle and blow out its brains. The tiger's habitual ferocity was
        temporarily quelled by the emotion of fear, which became sovereign,
        and formed a new centre for his character.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes no
        emotional state is sovereign, but many contrary ones are mixed
        together. In that case one hears <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg263"/> both <span class="tei tei-q">“yeses”</span> and
        <span class="tei tei-q">“noes,”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“will”</span> is called on then to solve the conflict.
        Take a soldier, for example, with his dread of cowardice impelling
        him to advance, his fears impelling him to run, and his propensities
        to imitation pushing him towards various courses if his comrades
        offer various examples. His person becomes the seat of a mass of
        interferences; and he may for a time simply waver, because no one
        emotion prevails. There is a pitch of intensity, though, which, if
        any emotion reach it, enthrones that one as alone effective and
        sweeps its antagonists and all their inhibitions away. The fury of
        his comrades' charge, once entered on, will give this pitch of
        courage to the soldier; the panic of their rout will give this pitch
        of fear. In these sovereign excitements, things ordinarily impossible
        grow natural because the inhibitions are annulled. Their <span class="tei tei-q">“no! no!”</span> not only is not heard, it does not
        exist. Obstacles are then like tissue-paper hoops to the circus
        rider—no impediment; the flood is higher than the dam they make.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Lass sie betteln gehn wenn sie hungrig
        sind!”</span> cries the grenadier, frantic over his Emperor's
        capture, when his wife and babes are suggested; and men pent into a
        burning theatre have been known to cut their way through the crowd
        with knives.<a href="#note_143" id="noteref_143" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">143</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg264"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One mode of
        emotional excitability is exceedingly important in the composition of
        the energetic character, from its peculiarly destructive power over
        inhibitions. I mean what in its lower form is mere irascibility,
        susceptibility to wrath, the fighting temper; and what in subtler
        ways manifests itself as impatience, grimness, earnestness, severity
        of character. Earnestness means willingness to live with energy,
        though energy bring pain. The pain may be pain to other people or
        pain to one's self—it makes little difference; for when the strenuous
        mood is on one, the aim is to break something, no matter whose or
        what. Nothing annihilates an inhibition as irresistibly as anger does
        it; for, as Moltke says of war, destruction pure and simple is its
        essence. This is what makes it so invaluable an ally of every other
        passion. The sweetest delights are trampled on with a ferocious
        pleasure the moment they offer themselves as checks to a cause by
        which our higher indignations are elicited. It costs then nothing to
        drop friendships, to renounce long-rooted privileges and possessions,
        to break with social ties. Rather do we take a stern joy in the
        astringency and desolation; and what is called weakness of character
        seems in most cases to consist in the inaptitude for these
        sacrificial moods, of which one's own inferior self and its pet
        softnesses must often be the targets and the victims.<a href="#note_144" id="noteref_144" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">144</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg265"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far I have
        spoken of temporary alterations produced by shifting excitements in
        the same person. But the relatively fixed differences of character of
        different persons are explained in a precisely similar way. In a man
        with a liability to a special sort of emotion, whole ranges of
        inhibition habitually vanish, which in other men remain effective,
        and other sorts of inhibition take their place. When a person has an
        inborn genius for certain emotions, his life differs strangely from
        that of ordinary people, for none of their usual deterrents check
        him. Your mere aspirant to a type of character, on the contrary, only
        shows, when your natural lover, fighter, or reformer, with whom the
        passion is a gift of nature, comes along, the hopeless inferiority of
        voluntary to instinctive action. He has deliberately to overcome his
        inhibitions; the genius with the inborn passion seems not to feel
        them at all; he is free of all that inner friction and nervous waste.
        To a Fox, a Garibaldi, a General Booth, a John Brown, a Louise
        Michel, a Bradlaugh, the obstacles omnipotent over those around them
        are as if non-existent. Could the rest of us so disregard them, there
        might be many such heroes, for many have the wish to live for similar
        ideals, and only the adequate degree of inhibition-quenching fury is
        lacking.<a href="#note_145" id="noteref_145" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">145</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg266"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The difference
        between willing and merely wishing, between having ideals that are
        creative and ideals that are but pinings and regrets, thus depends
        solely either on the amount of steam-pressure chronically driving the
        character in the ideal direction, or on the amount of ideal
        excitement transiently acquired. Given a certain amount of love,
        indignation, generosity, magnanimity, admiration, loyalty, or
        enthusiasm of self-surrender, the result is always the same. That
        whole raft of cowardly obstructions, which in tame persons and dull
        moods are sovereign impediments to action, sinks away at once. Our
        conventionality,<a href="#note_146" id="noteref_146" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">146</span></span></a> our
        shyness, laziness, and stinginess, our demands for precedent and
        permission, for guarantee and surety, our small suspicions,
        timidities, despairs, where are they now? Severed like cobwebs,
        broken like bubbles in the sun—</p>

        uplift gives to all creative ideal levels a bright and caroling
        quality, which is nowhere more marked than where the controlling
        emotion is religious. <span class="tei tei-q">“The true monk,”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may now turn
        from these psychological generalities to those fruits of the
        religious state which form the special subject of our present
        lecture. The man who lives in his religious centre of personal
        energy, and is actuated by spiritual enthusiasms, differs from his
        previous carnal self in perfectly definite ways. The new ardor which
        burns in his breast consumes in its glow the lower <span class="tei tei-q">“noes”</span> which formerly beset him, and keeps him
        immune against infection from the entire groveling portion of his
        nature. Magnanimities once impossible are now easy; paltry
        conventionalities and mean incentives once tyrannical hold no sway.
        The stone wall inside of him has fallen, the hardness in his heart
        has broken down. The rest of us can, I think, imagine this by
        recalling our state of feeling in those temporary <span class="tei tei-q">“melting moods”</span> into which either the trials of
        real life, or the theatre, or a novel sometimes throw us. Especially
        if we weep! For it is then as if our tears broke through an
        inveterate inner dam, and let all sorts of ancient peccancies and
        moral stagnancies drain away, leaving us now washed and soft of heart
        and open to every nobler leading. With most of us the customary
        hardness quickly returns, but not so with saintly persons. Many
        saints, even as energetic ones as Teresa and Loyola, have possessed
        what the church traditionally reveres as a special grace, the
        so-called gift of tears. In these persons the melting mood seems to
        have held almost uninterrupted control. And as it is with tears and
        melting moods, so it is with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg268"/> other exalted affections. Their reign may come
        by gradual growth or by a crisis; but in either case it may have
        <span class="tei tei-q">“come to stay.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the end of the
        last lecture we saw this permanence to be true of the general
        paramountcy of the higher insight, even though in the ebbs of
        emotional excitement meaner motives might temporarily prevail and
        backsliding might occur. But that lower temptations may remain
        completely annulled, apart from transient emotion and as if by
        alteration of the man's habitual nature, is also proved by
        documentary evidence in certain cases. Before embarking on the
        general natural history of the regenerate character, let me convince
        you of this curious fact by one or two examples. The most numerous
        are those of reformed drunkards. You recollect the case of Mr. Hadley
        in the last lecture; the Jerry McAuley Water Street Mission abounds
        in similar instances.<a href="#note_147" id="noteref_147" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a> You
        also remember the graduate of Oxford, converted at three in the
        afternoon, and getting drunk in the hay-field the next day, but after
        that permanently cured of his appetite. <span class="tei tei-q">“From
        that hour drink has had no terrors for me: I never touch it, never
        want it. The same thing occurred with my pipe, ... the desire for it
        went at once and has never returned. So with every known sin, the
        deliverance in each case being permanent and complete. I have had no
        temptations since conversion.”</span></p>

          deep breath of it, and praise the Lord, all my appetite for it was
          gone. Then as I walked along the street, passing saloons where the
          fumes of liquor came out, I found that all my taste and longing for
          that accursed stuff was gone. Glory to God! ... [But] for ten or

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The classic case
        of Colonel Gardiner is that of a man cured of sexual temptation in a

        Webster's words on the same subject are these: <span class="tei tei-q">“One thing I have heard the colonel frequently say, that
        he was much addicted to impurity before his acquaintance with
        religion; but that, so soon as he was enlightened from above, he felt

        Suggestive therapeutics abound in records of cure, after a few
        sittings, of inveterate bad habits with which the patient, left to
        ordinary moral and physical influences, had struggled in vain. Both
        drunkenness and sexual vice have been cured in this way, action
        through the subliminal seeming thus in many individuals to have the
        prerogative of inducing relatively stable change. If the grace of God
        miraculously operates, it probably operates through the subliminal
        door, then. But just <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how</span></em> anything operates in this region

        altogether,—leaving it, if you like, a good deal of a psychological

        become so passionate as to turn into self-immolation. It may then so
        overrule the ordinary inhibitions of the flesh that the saint finds
        positive pleasure in sacrifice and asceticism, measuring and
        expressing as they do the degree of his loyalty to the higher
        power.</p>

        Occasions of contact with such elements are avoided: the saintly life
        must deepen its spiritual consistency and keep unspotted from the
        world. In some temperaments this need of purity of spirit takes an
        ascetic turn, and weaknesses of the flesh are treated with relentless

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the sense of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In our narratives

        apart from anything acutely religious, we all have moments when the
        universal life seems to wrap us round with friendliness. In youth and
        health, in summer, in the woods or on the mountains, there come days
        when the weather seems all whispering with peace, hours when the
        goodness and beauty of existence enfold us like a dry warm climate,

        But, in the midst of a gentle rain, while these thoughts prevailed, I
        was suddenly sensible of such sweet and beneficent society in Nature,
        in the very pattering of the drops, and in every sight and sound
        around my house, an infinite and unaccountable friendliness all at
        once, like an atmosphere, sustaining me, as made the fancied
        advantages of human neighborhood insignificant, and I have never
        thought of them since. Every little pine-needle expanded and swelled

        that this sense of God's unfailing presence with them in their going
        out and in their coming in, and by night and day, is a source of
        absolute repose and confident calmness. It drives away all fear of
        what may befall them. That nearness of God is a constant security
        against terror and anxiety. It is not that they are at all assured of
        physical safety, or deem themselves protected by a love which is
        denied to others, but that they are in a state of mind equally ready
        to be safe or to meet with injury. If injury</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg276"/><span style="font-size: 90%">befall them,

        nothing can befall them without his will. If it be his will, then
        injury is for them a blessing and no calamity at all. Thus and thus
        only is the trustful man protected and shielded from harm. And I for
        one—by no means a thick-skinned or hard-nerved man—am absolutely
        satisfied with this arrangement, and do not wish for any other kind
        of immunity from danger and catastrophe. Quite as sensitive to pain
        as the most highly strung organism, I yet feel that the worst of it

        Edwards writes,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">was the
        sweetest night I ever had in my life. I never before, for so long a
        time together, enjoyed so much of the light and rest and sweetness of
        heaven in my soul, but without the least agitation of body during the
        whole time. Part of the night I lay awake, sometimes asleep, and
        sometimes between sleeping and waking. But all night I continued in a
        constant, clear, and lively sense of the heavenly sweetness of
        Christ's excellent love, of his nearness to me, and of my dearness to
        him; with an inexpressibly sweet calmness of soul in an entire rest
        in him. I seemed to myself to perceive a glow of divine love come
        down from the heart of Christ in heaven into my heart in a constant
        stream, like a stream or pencil of sweet light. At the same time my
        heart and soul all flowed out in love to Christ, so that there seemed
        to be a constant flowing and reflowing of heavenly love, and I
        appeared to myself to float or swim, in these bright, sweet beams,
        like the motes swimming in the beams of the sun, or the streams of
        his light which come in at the window. I think that what I felt each
        minute was worth more than all the outward comfort and pleasure which
        I had enjoyed in my whole life put</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg277"/><span style="font-size: 90%">together. It was
          pleasure, without the least sting, or any interruption. It was a
          sweetness, which my soul was lost in; it seemed to be all that my
          feeble frame could sustain. There was but little difference,
          whether I was asleep or awake, but if there was any difference, the
          sweetness was greatest while I was asleep.</span><a href="#note_158" id="noteref_158" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">158</span></span></a>
<span style="font-size: 90%">As I awoke early the next morning, it
          seemed to me that I had entirely done with myself. I felt that the
          opinions of the world concerning me were nothing, and that I had no
          more to do with any outward interest of my own than with that of a
          person whom I never saw. The glory of God seemed to swallow up
          every wish and desire of my heart.... After retiring to rest and
          sleeping a little while, I awoke, and was led to reflect on God's
          mercy to me, in giving me, for many years, a willingness to die;
          and after that, in making me willing to live, that I might do and
          suffer whatever he called me to here. I also thought how God had
          graciously given me an entire resignation to his will, with respect
          to the kind and manner of death that I should die; having been made
          willing to die on the rack, or at the stake, and if it were God's
          will, to die in darkness. But now it occurred to me, I used to
          think of living no longer than to the ordinary age of man. Upon
          this I was led to ask myself, whether I was not willing to be kept
          out of heaven even longer; and my whole heart seemed immediately to
          reply: Yes, a thousand years, and a thousand in horror, if it be
          most for the honor of God, the torment of my body being so great,
          awful, and overwhelming that none could bear to live in the country
          where the spectacle was seen, and the torment of my mind being
          vastly greater. And it seemed to me that I found a perfect
          willingness, quietness, and alacrity of soul in</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg278"/><span style="font-size: 90%">consenting
          that it should be so, if it were most for the glory of God, so that
          there was no hesitation, doubt, or darkness in my mind. The glory
          of God seemed to overcome me and swallow me up, and every
          conceivable suffering, and everything that was terrible to my
          nature, seemed to shrink to nothing before it. This resignation
          continued in its clearness and brightness the rest of the night,
          and all the next day, and the night following, and on Monday in the
          forenoon, without interruption or abatement.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_159" id="noteref_159" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The annals of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let me pass next
        to the Charity and Brotherly Love which are a usual fruit of
        saintliness, and have always been reckoned essential theological
        virtues, however limited may have been the kinds of service which the
        particular theology enjoined. Brotherly love would follow logically
        from the assurance of God's friendly presence, the notion of our
        brotherhood as men being an immediate inference from that of God's
        fatherhood of us all. When Christ utters the precepts: <span class="tei tei-q">“Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to
        them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and
        persecute you,”</span> he gives for a reason: <span class="tei tei-q">“That ye may be the children of your Father which is in
        heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good,
        and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.”</span> One might
        therefore <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg
        279]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg279"/> be
        tempted to explain both the humility as to one's self and the charity
        towards others which characterize spiritual excitement, as results of
        the all-leveling character of theistic belief. But these affections
        are certainly not mere derivatives of theism. We find them in
        Stoicism, in Hinduism, and in Buddhism in the highest possible
        degree. They harmonize with paternal theism beautifully; but they
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">harmonize</span></em> with all reflection
        whatever upon the dependence of mankind on general causes; and we
        must, I think, consider them not subordinate but coördinate parts of
        that great complex excitement in the study of which we are engaged.
        Religious rapture, moral enthusiasm, ontological wonder, cosmic
        emotion, are all unifying states of mind, in which the sand and grit
        of the selfhood incline to disappear, and tenderness to rule. The
        best thing is to describe the condition integrally as a
        characteristic affection to which our nature is liable, a region in
        which we find ourselves at home, a sea in which we swim; but not to
        pretend to explain its parts by deriving them too cleverly from one
        another. Like love or fear, the faith-state is a natural psychic
        complex, and carries charity with it by organic consequence.
        Jubilation is an expansive affection, and all expansive affections
        are self-forgetful and kindly so long as they endure.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We find this the
        case even when they are pathological in origin. In his instructive
        work, la Tristesse et la Joie,<a href="#note_161" id="noteref_161" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">161</span></span></a> M.
        Georges Dumas compares together the melancholy and the joyous phase
        of circular insanity, and shows that, while selfishness characterizes
        the one, the other is marked by altruistic impulses. No human being
        so stingy and useless as was Marie in her melancholy period! But the
        moment the happy period begins, <span class="tei tei-q">“sympathy and
        kindness become her characteristic sentiments. She displays
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg280"/> a universal goodwill, not only
        of intention, but in act.... She becomes solicitous of the health of
        other patients, interested in getting them out, desirous to procure
        wool to knit socks for some of them. Never since she has been under
        my observation have I heard her in her joyous period utter any but
        charitable opinions.”</span><a href="#note_162" id="noteref_162" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">162</span></span></a> And
        later, Dr. Dumas says of all such joyous conditions that <span class="tei tei-q">“unselfish sentiments and tender emotions are the only
        affective states to be found in them. The subject's mind is closed
        against envy, hatred, and vindictiveness, and wholly transformed into
        benevolence, indulgence, and mercy.”</span><a href="#note_163" id="noteref_163" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">163</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is thus an
        organic affinity between joyousness and tenderness, and their
        companionship in the saintly life need in no way occasion surprise.
        Along with the happiness, this increase of tenderness is often noted
        in narratives of conversion. <span class="tei tei-q">“I began to work
        for others”</span>;—<span class="tei tei-q">“I had more tender

        in its strength and sweetness, far beyond all that I had ever felt
        before. The power of that love seemed inexpressible. I thought, if I
        were surrounded by enemies, who were venting their malice and cruelty
        upon me, in tormenting me, it would still be impossible that I should
        cherish any feelings towards them but those of love, and pity, and

        Weaver's autobiography. Weaver was a collier, a semi-professional
        pugilist in his younger days, who became a much beloved evangelist.
        Fighting, after drinking, seems to have been the sin to which he
        originally felt his flesh most perversely inclined. After his first
        conversion he had a backsliding, which consisted in pounding a man
        who had insulted a girl. Feeling that, having once fallen, he might
        as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb, he got drunk and went
        and broke the jaw of another man who had lately challenged him to
        fight and taunted him with cowardice for refusing as a Christian
        man;—I mention these incidents to show how genuine a change of heart

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Love your enemies!”</span> Mark you, not simply those
        who happen not to be your friends, but your <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">enemies</span></em>,
        your positive and active enemies. Either this is a mere Oriental
        hyperbole, a bit of verbal extravagance, meaning only that we should,
        as far as we can, abate our animosities, or else it is sincere and
        literal. Outside of certain cases of intimate individual relation, it
        seldom has been taken literally. Yet it makes one ask the question:
        Can there in general be a level of emotion so unifying, so
        obliterative of differences between man and man, that even enmity may
        come to be an irrelevant circumstance and fail to inhibit the
        friendlier interests aroused? If positive well-wishing could attain
        so supreme a degree of excitement, those who were swayed by it might
        well seem superhuman beings. Their life would be morally discrete
        from the life of other men, and there is no saying, in the absence of
        positive experience of an authentic kind,—for there are few active
        examples in our scriptures, and the Buddhistic examples are
        legendary,<a href="#note_167" id="noteref_167" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">167</span></span></a>—what
        the effects might be: they might conceivably transform the world.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Psychologically
        and in principle, the precept <span class="tei tei-q">“Love your
        enemies”</span> is not self-contradictory. It is merely the extreme
        limit of a kind of magnanimity with which, in the shape of pitying
        tolerance of our oppressors, we are fairly familiar. Yet if radically
        followed, it would involve such a breach with our instinctive springs
        of action as a whole, and with the present world's arrangements,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg284"/> that a critical point would
        practically be passed, and we should be born into another kingdom of
        being. Religious emotion makes us feel that other kingdom to be close
        at hand, within our reach.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The inhibition of
        instinctive repugnance is proved not only by the showing of love to
        enemies, but by the showing of it to any one who is personally
        loathsome. In the annals of saintliness we find a curious mixture of
        motives impelling in this direction. Asceticism plays its part; and
        along with charity pure and simple, we find humility or the desire to
        disclaim distinction and to grovel on the common level before God.
        Certainly all three principles were at work when Francis of Assisi
        and Ignatius Loyola exchanged their garments with those of filthy
        beggars. All three are at work when religious persons consecrate
        their lives to the care of leprosy or other peculiarly unpleasant
        diseases. The nursing of the sick is a function to which the
        religious seem strongly drawn, even apart from the fact that church
        traditions set that way. But in the annals of this sort of charity we
        find fantastic excesses of devotion recorded which are only
        explicable by the frenzy of self-immolation simultaneously aroused.
        Francis of Assisi kisses his lepers; Margaret Mary Alacoque, Francis
        Xavier, St. John of God, and others are said to have cleansed the
        sores and ulcers of their patients with their respective tongues; and
        the lives of such saints as Elizabeth of Hungary and Madame de
        Chantal are full of a sort of reveling in hospital purulence,
        disagreeable to read of, and which makes us admire and shudder at the
        same time.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A paradise of inward tranquillity”</span> seems to be
        faith's usual result; and it is easy, even without being religious
        one's self, to understand this. A moment back, in treating of the
        sense of God's presence, I spoke of the unaccountable feeling of
        safety which one may then have. And, indeed, how can it possibly fail
        to steady the nerves, to cool the fever, and appease the fret, if one
        be sensibly conscious that, no matter what one's difficulties for the
        moment may appear to be, one's life as a whole is in the keeping of a
        power whom one can absolutely trust? In deeply religious men the
        abandonment of self to this power is passionate. Whoever not only
        says, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feels</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-q">“God's will be done,”</span> is mailed against every
        weakness; and the whole historic array of martyrs, missionaries, and
        religious reformers is there to prove the tranquil-mindedness, under
        naturally agitating or distressing circumstances, which
        self-surrender brings.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The temper of the
        tranquil-mindedness differs, of course, according as the person is of
        a constitutionally sombre or of a constitutionally cheerful cast of
        mind. In the sombre it partakes more of resignation and submission;
        in the cheerful it is a joyous consent. As an example of the former
        temper, I quote part of a letter from Professor Lagneau, a venerated
        teacher of philosophy who lately died, a great invalid, at
        Paris:—</p>

        and am worth what I am worth, only through the despair which is my
        sole strength and my sole foundation. May it preserve for me, even in
        these last trials to which I am coming, the courage to do without the
        desire of deliverance. I ask nothing more from the Source whence all
        strength cometh, and if that is granted, your wishes will have been

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The contempt of
        danger which religious enthusiasm produces may be even more buoyant
        still. I take an example from that charming recent autobiography,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“With Christ at Sea,”</span> by Frank Bullen.
        A couple of days after he went through the conversion on shipboard of

          of canvas to get north out of the bad weather. Shortly after four
          bells we hauled down the flying-jib, and I sprang out astride the
          boom to furl it. I was sitting astride the boom when suddenly it
          gave way with me. The sail slipped through my fingers, and I fell
          backwards, hanging head downwards</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg288"/><span style="font-size: 90%">over the seething
          tumult of shining foam under the ship's bows, suspended by one

          life. Although death was divided from me by a hair's breadth, and I
          was acutely conscious of the fact, it gave me no sensation but joy.
          I suppose I could have hung there no longer than five seconds, but
          in that time I lived a whole age of delight. But my body asserted
          itself, and with a desperate gymnastic effort I regained the boom.
          How I furled the sail I don't know, but I sang at the utmost pitch
          of my voice praises to God that went pealing out over the dark

        had so little patience that they took it off themselves, and I was

          influences, consolations, and peace which I felt interiorly? To
          understand them one must have passed by the same trial; they were

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The transition
        from tenseness, self-responsibility, and worry, to equanimity,
        receptivity, and peace, is the most wonderful of all those shiftings
        of inner equilibrium, those changes of the personal centre of energy,
        which I have analyzed so often; and the chief wonder of it is that it
        so often comes about, not by doing, but by simply relaxing and
        throwing the burden down. This abandonment of self-responsibility
        seems to be the fundamental act in specifically religious, as
        distinguished from moral practice. It antedates theologies and is
        independent of philosophies. Mind-cure, theosophy, stoicism, ordinary
        neurological hygiene, insist on it as emphatically as Christianity
        does, and it is capable of entering into closest marriage with every
        speculative creed.<a href="#note_173" id="noteref_173" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a>
        Christians who have it strongly live in what is called <span class="tei tei-q">“recollection,”</span> and are never anxious about the
        future, nor worry over the outcome of the day. Of Saint Catharine of
        Genoa it is said that <span class="tei tei-q">“she took cognizance of
        things, only as they were presented to her in succession, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moment by
        moment</span></em>.”</span> To her holy soul, <span class="tei tei-q">“the divine moment was the present moment,... and when
        the present moment was estimated in itself and in its relations, and
        when the duty that was involved in it was accomplished, it was
        permitted to pass away as if it had never been, and to give way to
        the facts and duties of the moment which came after.”</span><a href="#note_174" id="noteref_174" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">174</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg290"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hinduism,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next religious
        symptom which I will note is what I have called Purity of Life. The
        saintly person becomes exceedingly sensitive to inner inconsistency
        or discord, and mixture and confusion grow intolerable. All the
        mind's objects and occupations must be ordered with reference to the
        special spiritual excitement which is now its keynote. Whatever is
        unspiritual taints the pure water of the soul and is repugnant. Mixed
        with this exaltation of the moral sensibilities there is also an
        ardor of sacrifice, for the beloved deity's sake, of everything
        unworthy of him. Sometimes the spiritual ardor is so sovereign that
        purity is achieved at a stroke—we have seen examples. Usually it is a
        more gradual conquest. Billy Bray's account of his abandonment of
        tobacco is a good example of the latter form of achievement.</p>

        used to love my tobacco as much as I loved my meat, and I would
        rather go down into the mine without my dinner than without my pipe.
        In the days of old, the Lord spoke by the mouths of his servants, the
        prophets; now he speaks to us by the spirit of his Son. I had not
        only the feeling part of religion, but I could hear the small, still
        voice within speaking to me. When I took the pipe to smoke, it would
        be applied within,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">It is an idol,

        felt it was not right to smoke. The Lord also sent a woman to
        convince me. I was one day in a house, and I took out my pipe to
        light it at the fire, and Mary Hawke—for that was the woman's
        name—said,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Do you not feel

          and then I took the tobacco out of my pocket, and threw it into the

          have not smoked since. I found it hard to break off old habits, but
          I cried to the Lord for help, and he gave me strength, for he has

          in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">The
          day after I gave up smoking I had the toothache so bad that I did
          not know what to do. I thought this was owing to giving up the
          pipe, but I said I would never smoke again, if I lost every tooth
          in my head. I said,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Lord, thou
          hast told us My yoke is easy and my burden is
          light,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">and when I said that, all the pain
          left me. Sometimes the thought of the pipe would come back to me
          very strong; but the Lord strengthened me against the habit, and,
          bless his name, I have not smoked since.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>

<span style="font-size: 90%">So, when we got up from our knees, I

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ascetic forms
        which the impulse for veracity and purity of life may take are often
        pathetic enough. The early Quakers, for example, had hard battles to
        wage against the worldliness and insincerity of the ecclesiastical
        Christianity of their time. Yet the battle that cost them most wounds
        was probably that which they fought in defense of their own right to
        social veracity and sincerity in their thee-ing and thou-ing, in not
        doffing the hat or giving titles of respect. It was laid on George
        Fox <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg292"/> that these
        conventional customs were a lie and a sham, and the whole body of his
        followers thereupon renounced them, as a sacrifice to truth, and so
        that their acts and the spirit they professed might be more in
        accord.</p>

          my leg to any one. This made the sects and professions rage. Oh!
          the rage that was in the priests, magistrates, professors, and
          people of all sorts: and especially in priests and professors: for

          besides the danger we were sometimes in of losing our lives for
          this matter, and that by the great professors of Christianity, who
          thereby discovered they were not true believers. And though it was
          but a small thing in the eye of man, yet a wonderful confusion it

          Real cleanliness becometh a holy people; but hiding that which is
          not clean by coloring our garments seems contrary to the sweetness
          of sincerity. Through some sorts of dyes cloth is rendered less

          uneasy to me. On this account I was under close exercise of mind in
          the time of our general spring meeting in 1762, greatly desiring to
          be rightly directed; when, being deeply bowed in spirit before the
          Lord, I was made willing to submit to what I apprehended was

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the craving
        for moral consistency and purity is developed to this degree, the
        subject may well find the outer world too full of shocks to dwell in,
        and can unify his life and keep his soul unspotted only by
        withdrawing from it. That law which impels the artist to achieve
        harmony in his composition by simply dropping out whatever jars, or
        suggests a discord, rules also in the spiritual life. To omit, says
        Stevenson, is the one art in literature: <span class="tei tei-q">“If
        I knew how to omit, I should ask no other knowledge.”</span> And
        life, when full of disorder and slackness and vague superfluity, can
        no more have what we call character than literature can have it under
        similar conditions. So monasteries and communities of sympathetic
        devotees open their doors, and in their changeless order,
        characterized by omissions quite as much as constituted of actions,
        the holy-minded person finds that inner smoothness and cleanness
        which it is torture to him to feel violated at every turn by the
        discordancy and brutality of secular existence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the
        scrupulosity of purity may be carried to a fantastic extreme must be
        admitted. In this it resembles Asceticism, to which further symptom
        of saintliness we had better turn next. The adjective <span class="tei tei-q">“ascetic”</span> is applied to conduct originating on
        diverse psychological levels, which I might as well begin by
        distinguishing from one another.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">4. Again, ascetic mortifications and torments may
          be due to pessimistic feelings about the self, combined with
          theological beliefs concerning expiation. The devotee may feel that
          he is buying himself free, or escaping worse sufferings hereafter,
          by doing penance now.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">5. In psychopathic persons, mortifications may be
          entered on irrationally, by a sort of obsession or fixed idea which
          comes as a challenge and must be worked off, because only thus does
          the subject get his interior consciousness feeling right
          again.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">6. Finally, ascetic exercises may in rarer
          instances be prompted by genuine perversions of the bodily
          sensibility, in consequence of which normally pain-giving stimuli
          are actually felt as pleasures.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I will try to give
        an instance under each of these heads in turn; but it is not easy to
        get them pure, for in cases pronounced enough to be immediately
        classed as ascetic, several of the assigned motives usually work
        together. Moreover, before citing any examples at all, I must invite
        you to some general psychological considerations which apply to all
        of them alike.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A strange moral
        transformation has within the past century swept over our Western
        world. We no longer think that we are called on to face physical pain
        with equanimity. It is not expected of a man that he should either
        endure it or inflict much of it, and to listen to the recital of
        cases of it makes our flesh creep morally as well as physically. The
        way in which our ancestors <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg
        298]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg298"/>
        looked upon pain as an eternal ingredient of the world's order, and
        both caused and suffered it as a matter-of-course portion of their
        day's work, fills us with amazement. We wonder that any human beings
        could have been so callous. The result of this historic alteration is
        that even in the Mother Church herself, where ascetic discipline has
        such a fixed traditional prestige as a factor of merit, it has
        largely come into desuetude, if not discredit. A believer who
        flagellates or <span class="tei tei-q">“macerates”</span> himself
        to-day arouses more wonder and fear than emulation. Many Catholic
        writers who admit that the times have changed in this respect do so
        resignedly; and even add that perhaps it is as well not to waste
        feelings in regretting the matter, for to return to the heroic
        corporeal discipline of ancient days might be an extravagance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Where to seek the
        easy and the pleasant seems instinctive—and instinctive it appears to
        be in man; any deliberate tendency to pursue the hard and painful as
        such and for their own sakes might well strike one as purely
        abnormal. Nevertheless, in moderate degrees it is natural and even
        usual to human nature to court the arduous. It is only the extreme
        manifestations of the tendency that can be regarded as a paradox.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The psychological
        reasons for this lie near the surface. When we drop abstractions and
        take what we call our will in the act, we see that it is a very
        complex function. It involves both stimulations and inhibitions; it
        follows generalized habits; it is escorted by reflective criticisms;
        and it leaves a good or a bad taste of itself behind, according to
        the manner of the performance. The result is that, quite apart from
        the immediate pleasure which any sensible experience may give us, our
        own general moral attitude in procuring or undergoing the experience
        brings with it a secondary satisfaction or distaste. Some
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg299"/> men and women, indeed, there
        are who can live on smiles and the word <span class="tei tei-q">“yes”</span> forever. But for others (indeed for most),
        this is too tepid and relaxed a moral climate. Passive happiness is
        slack and insipid, and soon grows mawkish and intolerable. Some
        austerity and wintry negativity, some roughness, danger, stringency,
        and effort, some <span class="tei tei-q">“no! no!”</span> must be
        mixed in, to produce the sense of an existence with character and
        texture and power. The range of individual differences in this
        respect is enormous; but whatever the mixture of yeses and noes may
        be, the person is infallibly aware when he has struck it in the right
        proportion <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for him</span></em>. This, he feels, is my
        proper vocation, this is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">optimum</span></em>, the law, the life for me to
        live. Here I find the degree of equilibrium, safety, calm, and
        leisure which I need, or here I find the challenge, passion, fight,
        and hardship without which my soul's energy expires.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every individual
        soul, in short, like every individual machine or organism, has its
        own best conditions of efficiency. A given machine will run best
        under a certain steam-pressure, a certain amperage; an organism under
        a certain diet, weight, or exercise. You seem to do best, I heard a
        doctor say to a patient, at about 140 millimeters of arterial
        tension. And it is just so with our sundry souls: some are happiest
        in calm weather; some need the sense of tension, of strong volition,
        to make them feel alive and well. For these latter souls, whatever is
        gained from day to day must be paid for by sacrifice and inhibition,
        or else it comes too cheap and has no zest.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now when
        characters of this latter sort become religious, they are apt to turn
        the edge of their need of effort and negativity against their natural
        self; and the ascetic life gets evolved as a consequence.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Professor
        Tyndall in one of his lectures tells us <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg300"/> that Thomas Carlyle put him into his bath-tub
        every morning of a freezing Berlin winter, he proclaimed one of the
        lowest grades of asceticism. Even without Carlyle, most of us find it
        necessary to our soul's health to start the day with a rather cool
        immersion. A little farther along the scale we get such statements as
        this, from one of my correspondents, an agnostic:—</p>

        manhood.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such cases as
        these belong simply to our head 1. In the next case we probably have
        a mixture of heads 2 and 3—the asceticism becomes far more systematic
        and pronounced. The writer is a Protestant, whose sense of moral
        energy could doubtless be gratified on no lower terms, and I take his
        case from Starbuck's manuscript collection.</p>

        of humanity, and of which I will speak later under the head of the
        cult of poverty, doubtless bore also a share. Certainly there was no
        pessimistic element in his case. In the next case we have a strongly
        pessimistic element, so that it belongs under head 4. John Cennick
        was Methodism's first lay preacher. In 1735 he was convicted of sin,
        while walking in Cheapside,—</p>

        to spend his life in devout retirement. At other times he longed to
        live in a cave, sleeping on fallen leaves, and feeding on forest
        fruits. He fasted long and often, and prayed nine times a day....
        Fancying dry bread too great an indulgence for so great a sinner as
        himself, he began to feed on potatoes, acorns, crabs, and grass; and
        often wished that he could live on roots</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg302"/><span style="font-size: 90%">and herbs. At

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this poor man
        we have morbid melancholy and fear, and the sacrifices made are to
        purge out sin, and to buy safety. The hopelessness of Christian
        theology in respect of the flesh and the natural man generally has,
        in systematizing fear, made of it one tremendous incentive to
        self-mortification. It would be quite unfair, however, in spite of
        the fact that this incentive has often been worked in a mercenary way
        for hortatory purposes, to call it a mercenary incentive. The impulse
        to expiate and do penance is, in its first intention, far too
        immediate and spontaneous an expression of self-despair and anxiety
        to be obnoxious to any such reproach. In the form of loving
        sacrifice, of spending all we have to show our devotion, ascetic
        discipline of the severest sort may be the fruit of highly optimistic
        religious feeling.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">M. Vianney, the

        exemplary. We read in his life the following account of his inner

        Vianney said,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">it is only the
        first step that costs. There is in mortification a balm and a savor
        without which one cannot live when once one has made their
        acquaintance. There is but one way in which to give one's self to
        God,—that is, to give one's self entirely, and to keep nothing for
        one's self. The little that one keeps is only good to double one and
        make one suffer.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">Accordingly he imposed it on himself
        that he should never smell a flower, never drink when parched with
        thirst, never drive away a fly, never show disgust before a repugnant
        object, never complain of anything that had to do with his personal
        comfort, never sit down, never lean upon his elbows when he was
        kneeling. The Curé of Ars was very sensitive to cold, but he would
        never take means to protect</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg303"/><span style="font-size: 90%">himself against it.
        During a very severe winter, one of his missionaries contrived a

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this case the
        spontaneous impulse to make sacrifices for the pure love of God was
        probably the uppermost conscious motive. We may class it, then, under
        our head 3. Some authors think that the impulse to sacrifice is the
        main religious phenomenon. It is a prominent, a universal phenomenon
        certainly, and lies deeper than any special creed. Here, for
        instance, is what seems to be a spontaneous example of it, simply
        expressing what seemed right at the time between the individual and
        his Maker. Cotton Mather, the New England Puritan divine, is
        generally reputed a rather grotesque pedant; yet what is more
        touchingly simple than his relation of what happened when his wife
        came to die?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Father Vianney's
        asceticism taken in its totality was simply the result of a permanent
        flood of high spiritual enthusiasm, longing to make proof of itself.
        The Roman Church has, in its incomparable fashion, collected all the
        motives towards asceticism together, and so codified them that any
        one wishing to pursue Christian perfection may find a practical
        system mapped out for him in any one of a number of ready-made
        manuals.<a href="#note_180" id="noteref_180" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">180</span></span></a> The
        dominant Church notion of perfection is of course the negative one of
        avoidance of sin. Sin proceeds from concupiscence, and concupiscence
        from our carnal passions and temptations, chief of which are pride,
        sensuality in all its forms, and the loves of worldly excitement and
        possession. All these sources of sin must be resisted; and discipline
        and austerities are a most efficacious mode of meeting them. Hence
        there are always in these books chapters on self-mortification. But
        whenever a procedure is codified, the more delicate spirit of it
        evaporates, and if we wish the undiluted ascetic spirit,—the passion
        of self-contempt wreaking itself on the poor flesh, the divine
        irrationality of devotion making a sacrificial gift of all it has
        (its sensibilities, namely) to the object of its adoration,—we must
        go to autobiographies, or other individual documents.</p>

        and life; and when this began to make itself felt, it was very
        grievous to him; and he sought by many devices how he might bring his
        body into subjection. He wore for a long time a hair shirt and an
        iron chain, until the blood ran from him, so that he was obliged to
        leave them off. He secretly caused an undergarment to be made for
        him; and in the undergarment he had strips of leather fixed, into
        which a hundred and fifty brass nails, pointed and filed sharp, were
        driven, and the points of the nails were always turned towards the
        flesh. He had this garment made very tight, and so arranged as to go
        round him and fasten in front, in order that it might fit the closer
        to his body, and the pointed nails might be driven into his flesh;
        and it was high enough to reach upwards to his navel. In this he used
        to sleep at night. Now in summer, when it was hot, and he was very

        does when run through with a pointed needle. It often seemed to him

          each side his throat, and made the fastenings so secure that even
          if his cell had been</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg308"/><span style="font-size: 90%">on fire about
          him, he could not have helped himself. This he continued until his
          hands and arms had become almost tremulous with the strain, and
          then he devised something else: two leather gloves; and he caused a
          brazier to fit them all over with sharp-pointed brass tacks, and he
          used to put them on at night, in order that if he should try while
          asleep to throw off the hair undergarment, or relieve himself from
          the gnawings of the vile insects, the tacks might then stick into
          his body. And so it came to pass. If ever he sought to help himself
          with his hands in his sleep, he drove the sharp tacks into his
          breast, and tore himself, so that his flesh festered. When after
          many weeks the wounds had healed, he tore himself again and made
          fresh wounds.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">He continued this tormenting exercise for about
          sixteen years. At the end of this time, when his blood was now
          chilled, and the fire of his temperament destroyed, there appeared
          to him in a vision on Whitsunday, a messenger from heaven, who told
          him that God required this of him no longer. Whereupon he
          discontinued it, and threw all these things away into a running
          stream.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Suso then tells how, to emulate the sorrows of his
          crucified Lord, he made himself a cross with thirty protruding iron
          needles and nails. This he bore on his bare back between his
          shoulders day and night.</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">The first time that he stretched out this cross
          upon his back his tender frame was struck with terror at it, and
          blunted the sharp nails slightly against a stone. But soon,
          repenting of this womanly cowardice, he pointed them all again with
          a file, and placed once more the cross upon him. It made his back,
          where the bones are, bloody and seared. Whenever he sat down or
          stood up, it was as if a hedgehog-skin were on him. If any one
          touched him unawares, or pushed against his clothes, it tore
          him.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Suso next tells of his penitences by means of
          striking this cross and forcing the nails deeper into the flesh,
          and likewise of his self-scourgings,—a dreadful story,—and then
          goes on as follows:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">At this same
          period the Servitor procured an old castaway door, and he used to
          lie upon it at night without any bedclothes to make him
          comfortable, except that he took off</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg309"/><span style="font-size: 90%">his shoes
          and wrapped a thick cloak round him. He thus secured for himself a
          most miserable bed; for hard pea-stalks lay in humps under his
          head, the cross with the sharp nails stuck into his back, his arms
          were locked fast in bonds, the horsehair undergarment was round his
          loins, and the cloak too was heavy and the door hard. Thus he lay
          in wretchedness, afraid to stir, just like a log, and he would send
          up many a sigh to God.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">In winter he suffered very much from the frost. If
          he stretched out his feet they lay bare on the floor and froze, if
          he gathered them up the blood became all on fire in his legs, and
          this was great pain. His feet were full of sores, his legs
          dropsical, his knees bloody and seared, his loins covered with
          scars from the horsehair, his body wasted, his mouth parched with
          intense thirst, and his hands tremulous from weakness. Amid these
          torments he spent his nights and days; and he endured them all out
          of the greatness of the love which he bore in his heart to the
          Divine and Eternal Wisdom, our Lord Jesus Christ, whose agonizing
          sufferings he sought to imitate. After a time he gave up this
          penitential exercise of the door, and instead of it he took up his
          abode in a very small cell, and used the bench, which was so narrow
          and short that he could not stretch himself upon it, as his bed. In
          this hole, or upon the door, he lay at night in his usual bonds,
          for about eight years. It was also his custom, during the space of
          twenty-five years, provided he was staying in the convent, never to
          go after compline in winter into any warm room, or to the convent
          stove to warm himself, no matter how cold it might be, unless he
          was obliged to do so for other reasons. Throughout all these years
          he never took a bath, either a water or a sweating bath; and this
          he did in order to mortify his comfort-seeking body. He practiced
          during a long time such rigid poverty that he would neither receive
          nor touch a penny, either with leave or without it. For a
          considerable time he strove to attain such a high degree of purity
          that he would neither scratch nor touch any part of his body, save
          only his hands and feet.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_183" id="noteref_183" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">183</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I spare you the
        recital of poor Suso's self-inflicted tortures from thirst. It is
        pleasant to know that after his fortieth year, God showed him by a
        series of visions that he had sufficiently broken down the natural
        man, and that he might leave these exercises off. His case is
        distinctly pathological, but he does not seem to have had the
        alleviation, which some ascetics have enjoyed, of an alteration of
        sensibility capable of actually turning torment into a perverse kind

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So much for the
        phenomena to which the ascetic impulse will in certain persons give
        rise. In the ecclesiastically consecrated character three minor
        branches of self-mortification have been recognized as indispensable
        pathways to perfection. I refer to the chastity, obedience, and
        poverty which the monk vows to observe; and upon the heads of
        obedience and poverty I will make a few remarks.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First, of
        Obedience. The secular life of our twentieth century opens with this
        virtue held in no high esteem. The duty of the individual to
        determine his own conduct and profit or suffer by the consequences
        seems, on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg
        311]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg311"/>
        contrary, to be one of our best rooted contemporary Protestant social
        ideals. So much so that it is difficult even imaginatively to
        comprehend how men possessed of an inner life of their own could ever
        have come to think the subjection of its will to that of other finite
        creatures recommendable. I confess that to myself it seems something
        of a mystery. Yet it evidently corresponds to a profound interior
        need of many persons, and we must do our best to understand it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the lowest
        possible plane, one sees how the expediency of obedience in a firm
        ecclesiastical organization must have led to its being viewed as
        meritorious. Next, experience shows that there are times in every
        one's life when one can be better counseled by others than by one's
        self. Inability to decide is one of the commonest symptoms of
        fatigued nerves; friends who see our troubles more broadly, often see
        them more wisely than we do; so it is frequently an act of excellent
        virtue to consult and obey a doctor, a partner, or a wife. But,
        leaving these lower prudential regions, we find, in the nature of
        some of the spiritual excitements which we have been studying, good
        reasons for idealizing obedience. Obedience may spring from the
        general religious phenomenon of inner softening and self-surrender
        and throwing one's self on higher powers. So saving are these
        attitudes felt to be that in themselves, apart from utility, they
        become ideally consecrated; and in obeying a man whose fallibility we
        see through thoroughly, we, nevertheless, may feel much as we do when
        we resign our will to that of infinite wisdom. Add self-despair and
        the passion of self-crucifixion to this, and obedience becomes an
        ascetic sacrifice, agreeable quite irrespective of whatever
        prudential uses it might have.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is as a
        sacrifice, a mode of <span class="tei tei-q">“mortification,”</span>
        that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg312"/> obedience is primarily
        conceived by Catholic writers, a <span class="tei tei-q">“sacrifice
        which man offers to God, and of which he is himself both the priest
        and the victim. By poverty he immolates his exterior possessions; by
        chastity he immolates his body; by obedience he completes the
        sacrifice, and gives to God all that he yet holds as his own, his two
        most precious goods, his intellect and his will. The sacrifice is
        then complete and unreserved, a genuine holocaust, for the entire
        victim is now consumed for the honor of God.”</span><a href="#note_185" id="noteref_185" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">185</span></span></a>
        Accordingly, in Catholic discipline, we obey our superior not as mere
        man, but as the representative of Christ. Obeying God in him by our
        intention, obedience is easy. But when the text-book theologians
        marshal collectively all their reasons for recommending it, the
        mixture sounds to our ears rather odd.</p>

<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">is the
          assurance we have that in obeying we can commit no fault. The
          Superior may commit a fault in commanding you to do this thing or
          that, but you are certain that you commit no fault so long as you
          obey, because God will only ask you if you have duly performed what
          orders you received, and if you can furnish a clear account in that
          respect, you are absolved entirely. Whether the things you did were
          opportune, or whether there were not something better that might
          have been done, these are questions not asked of you, but rather of
          your Superior. The moment what you did was done obediently, God
          wipes it out of your account, and charges it to the Superior. So
          that Saint Jerome well exclaimed, in celebrating the advantages of
          obedience,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Oh, sovereign
          liberty! Oh, holy and blessed security by which one becomes almost
          impeccable!</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Saint John Climachus is of the same sentiment when
          he calls obedience an excuse before God. In fact, when God asks why
          you have done this or that, and you reply, it is because I</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg313"/><span style="font-size: 90%">was so ordered by my Superiors, God will ask for
          no other excuse. As a passenger in a good vessel with a good pilot
          need give himself no farther concern, but may go to sleep in peace,
          because the pilot has charge over all, and</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">watches for him</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">; so a
          religious person who lives under the yoke of obedience goes to
          heaven as if while sleeping, that is, while leaning entirely on the
          conduct of his Superiors, who are the pilots of his vessel, and
          keep watch for him continually. It is no small thing, of a truth,
          to be able to cross the stormy sea of life on the shoulders and in
          the arms of another, yet that is just the grace which God accords
          to those who live under the yoke of obedience. Their Superior bears
          all their burdens.... A certain grave doctor said that he would
          rather spend his life in picking up straws by obedience, than by
          his own responsible choice busy himself with the loftiest works of
          charity, because one is certain of following the will of God in
          whatever one may do from obedience, but never certain in the same
          degree of anything which we may do of our own proper
          movement.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_186" id="noteref_186" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">186</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One should read

        up no difference between one Superior and another, ... but recognize
        them all as equal before God, whose place they fill. For if I

        subject of obedience, I will, to give immediately a concrete turn to
        our discussion of poverty, also read you a page from his chapter on
        this latter virtue. You must remember that he is writing instructions
        for monks of his own order, and bases them all on the text,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed are the poor in spirit.”</span></p>

        he loves the ordinary consequences and effects of poverty, which are
        hunger, thirst, cold, fatigue, and the denudation of all
        conveniences. See if you are glad to wear a worn-out habit full of
        patches. See if you are glad when something is lacking to your meal,
        when you are passed by in serving it, when what you receive is
        distasteful to you, when your cell is out of repair. If you are not
        glad of these things, if instead of loving them you avoid them, then
        there is proof that you have not attained the perfection of poverty
        of spirit.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">Rodriguez then goes on to describe the
        practice of poverty in more detail.</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">The first point is that which Saint Ignatius
        proposes in his constitutions, when he says,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Let no one use anything as if it were his private
        possession.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>

          to be like a statue which one may drape with clothing, but which
          feels no grief and makes no resistance when one</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg316"/><span style="font-size: 90%">strips it
          again. It is in this way that you should feel towards your clothes,
          your books, your cell, and everything else that you make use of; if
          ordered to quit them, or to exchange them for others, have no more
          sorrow than if you were a statue being uncovered. In this way you
          will avoid using them as if they were your private possession. But
          if, when you give up your cell, or yield possession of this or that
          object or exchange it for another, you feel repugnance and are not
          like a statue, that shows that you view these things as if they
          were your private property.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">And this is why our holy founder wished the
          superiors to test their monks somewhat as God tested Abraham, and
          to put their poverty and their obedience to trial, that by this
          means they may become acquainted with the degree of their virtue,
          and gain a chance to make ever farther progress in perfection, ...
          making the one move out of his room when he finds it comfortable
          and is attached to it; taking away from another a book of which he
          is fond; or obliging a third to exchange his garment for a worse
          one. Otherwise we should end by acquiring a species of property in
          all these several objects, and little by little the wall of poverty
          that surrounds us and constitutes our principal defense would be
          thrown down. The ancient fathers of the desert used often thus to
          treat their companions.... Saint Dositheus, being sick-nurse,
          desired a certain knife, and asked Saint Dorotheus for it, not for
          his private use, but for employment in the infirmary of which he
          had charge. Whereupon Saint Dorotheus answered him:</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Ha!
          Dositheus, so that knife pleases you so much! Will you be the slave
          of a knife or the slave of Jesus Christ? Do you not blush with
          shame at wishing that a knife should be your master? I will not let
          you touch it.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">Which reproach and refusal had such an
          effect upon the holy disciple that since that time he never touched
          the knife again.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">...</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Therefore, in our rooms,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">Father Rodriguez continues,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">there must be no other furniture than a bed, a
          table, a bench, and a candlestick, things purely necessary, and
          nothing more. It is not allowed among us that our cells should be
          ornamented with pictures or aught else, neither armchairs, carpets,
          curtains,</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg
          317]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg317"/><span style="font-size: 90%">nor any sort of
          cabinet or bureau of any elegance. Neither is it allowed us to keep
          anything to eat, either for ourselves or for those who may come to
          visit us. We must ask permission to go to the refectory even for a
          glass of water; and finally we may not keep a book in which we can
          write a line, or which we may take away with us. One cannot deny
          that thus we are in great poverty. But this poverty is at the same
          time a great repose and a great perfection. For it would be
          inevitable, in case a religious person were allowed to own
          superfluous possessions, that these things would greatly occupy his
          mind, be it to acquire them, to preserve them, or to increase them;
          so that in not permitting us at all to own them, all these
          inconveniences are remedied. Among the various good reasons why the
          company forbids secular persons to enter our cells, the principal
          one is that thus we may the easier be kept in poverty. After all,
          we are all men, and if we were to receive people of the world into
          our rooms, we should not have the strength to remain within the
          bounds prescribed, but should at least wish to adorn them with some
          books to give the visitors a better opinion of our
          scholarship.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_191" id="noteref_191" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">191</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since Hindu
        fakirs, Buddhist monks, and Mohammedan dervishes unite with Jesuits
        and Franciscans in idealizing poverty as the loftiest individual
        state, it is worth while to examine into the spiritual grounds for
        such a seemingly unnatural opinion. And first, of those which lie
        closest to common human nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The opposition
        between the men who <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have</span></em> and the men who <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em> is
        immemorial. Though the gentleman, in the old-fashioned sense of the
        man who is well born, has usually in point of fact been predaceous
        and reveled in lands and goods, yet he has never identified his
        essence with these possessions, but rather with the personal
        superiorities, the courage, generosity, and pride supposed to be his
        birthright. To certain huckstering kinds of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg318"/> consideration he thanked God he was forever
        inaccessible, and if in life's vicissitudes he should become
        destitute through their lack, he was glad to think that with his
        sheer valor he was all the freer to work out his salvation.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Wer nur selbst was hätte,”</span> says
        Lessing's Tempelherr, in Nathan the Wise, <span class="tei tei-q">“mein Gott, mein Gott, ich habe nichts!”</span> This
        ideal of the well-born man without possessions was embodied in
        knight-errantry and templardom; and, hideously corrupted as it has
        always been, it still dominates sentimentally, if not practically,
        the military and aristocratic view of life. We glorify the soldier as
        the man absolutely unencumbered. Owning nothing but his bare life,
        and willing to toss that up at any moment when the cause commands
        him, he is the representative of unhampered freedom in ideal
        directions. The laborer who pays with his person day by day, and has
        no rights invested in the future, offers also much of this ideal
        detachment. Like the savage, he may make his bed wherever his right
        arm can support him, and from his simple and athletic attitude of
        observation, the property-owner seems buried and smothered in ignoble
        externalities and trammels, <span class="tei tei-q">“wading in straw
        and rubbish to his knees.”</span> The claims which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">things</span></em>
        make are corrupters of manhood, mortgages on the soul, and a drag
        anchor on our progress towards the empyrean.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In short, lives
        based on having are less free than lives based either on doing or on
        being, and in the interest of action people subject to spiritual
        excitement throw away possessions as so many clogs. Only those who
        have no private interests can follow an ideal straight away. Sloth
        and cowardice creep in with every dollar or guinea we have to guard.
        When a brother novice came to Saint Francis, saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“Father, it would be a great consolation to me to own a
        psalter, but even supposing that our general should concede to me
        this indulgence, still I should like also to have your
        consent,”</span> Francis put him off with the examples of
        Charlemagne, Roland, and Oliver, pursuing the infidels in sweat and
        labor, and finally dying on the field of battle. <span class="tei tei-q">“So care not,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“for owning books and knowledge, but care rather for
        works of goodness.”</span> And when some weeks later the novice came
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg320"/> again to talk of his craving
        for the psalter, Francis said: <span class="tei tei-q">“After you
        have got your psalter you will crave a breviary; and after you have
        got your breviary you will sit in your stall like a grand prelate,
        and will say to your brother: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Hand me my
        breviary.’</span> ... And thenceforward he denied all such requests,
        saying: <span class="tei tei-q">‘A man possesses of learning only so
        much as comes out of him in action, and a monk is a good preacher
        only so far as his deeds proclaim him such, for every tree is known
        by its fruits.’</span> ”</span><a href="#note_194" id="noteref_194" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">194</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But beyond this
        more worthily athletic attitude involved in doing and being, there
        is, in the desire of not having, something profounder still,
        something related to that fundamental mystery of religious
        experience, the satisfaction found in absolute surrender to the
        larger power. So long as any secular safeguard is retained, so long
        as any residual prudential guarantee is clung to, so long the
        surrender is incomplete, the vital crisis is not passed, fear still
        stands sentinel, and mistrust of the divine obtains: we hold by two
        anchors, looking to God, it is true, after a fashion, but also
        holding by our proper machinations. In certain medical experiences we
        have the same critical point to overcome. A drunkard, or a morphine
        or cocaine maniac, offers himself to be cured. He appeals to the
        doctor to wean him from his enemy, but he dares not face blank
        abstinence. The tyrannical drug is still an anchor to windward: he
        hides supplies of it among his clothing; arranges secretly to have it
        smuggled in in case of need. Even so an incompletely regenerate man
        still trusts in his own expedients. His money is like the sleeping
        potion which the chronically wakeful patient keeps beside his bed; he
        throws himself on God, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">if</span></em> he should need the other help,
        there it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg
        321]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg321"/>
        will be also. Every one knows cases of this incomplete and
        ineffective desire for reform,—drunkards whom, with all their
        self-reproaches and resolves, one perceives to be quite unwilling
        seriously to contemplate <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never</span></em> being drunk again! Really to
        give up anything on which we have relied, to give it up definitively,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“for good and all”</span> and forever,
        signifies one of those radical alterations of character which came
        under our notice in the lectures on conversion. In it the inner man
        rolls over into an entirely different position of equilibrium, lives
        in a new centre of energy from this time on, and the turning-point
        and hinge of all such operations seems usually to involve the sincere
        acceptance of certain nakednesses and destitutions.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accordingly,
        throughout the annals of the saintly life, we find this
        ever-recurring note: Fling yourself upon God's providence without
        making any reserve whatever,—take no thought for the morrow,—sell all
        you have and give it to the poor,—only when the sacrifice is ruthless
        and reckless will the higher safety really arrive. As a concrete
        example let me read a page from the biography of Antoinette
        Bourignon, a good woman, much persecuted in her day by both
        Protestants and Catholics, because she would not take her religion at
        second hand. When a young girl, in her father's house,—</p>

        repeating:</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Lord, what wilt thou have me to
        do?</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">And being one night in
        a most profound penitence, she said from the bottom of her
        heart:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">O my Lord! What
        must I do to please thee? For I have nobody to teach me. Speak to my
        soul and it will hear thee.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">At that
        instant she heard, as if another had spoke within her:</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Forsake all earthly things.
        Separate thyself from the love of the creatures. Deny
        thyself.</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">She was quite
        astonished, not understanding this language, and mused long on these
        three points, thinking how she could fulfill them. She thought she
        could not live without earthly things, nor without loving the
        creatures,</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg
        322]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg322"/><span style="font-size: 90%">nor without loving
        herself. Yet she said,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">By thy Grace I
        will do it, Lord!</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">But when she would perform her promise,
        she knew not where to begin. Having thought on the religious in
        monasteries, that they forsook all earthly things by being shut up in
        a cloister, and the love of themselves by subjecting of their wills,
        she asked leave of her father to enter into a cloister of the
        barefoot Carmelites, but he would not permit it, saying he would
        rather see her laid in her grave. This seemed to her a great cruelty,
        for she thought to find in the cloister the true Christians she had
        been seeking, but she found afterwards that he knew the cloisters
        better than she; for after he had forbidden her, and told her he
        would never permit her to be a religious, nor give her any money to
        enter there, yet she went to Father Laurens, the Director, and
        offered to serve in the monastery and work hard for her bread, and be
        content with little, if he would receive her. At which he smiled and
        said:</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">That cannot be. We must have

          undeceived as to the cloisters, resolving to forsake all company
          and live alone till it should please God to show her what she ought
          to do and whither to go. She asked always earnestly,</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">When shall I
          be perfectly thine, O my God?</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">And
          she thought he still answered her,</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">When
          thou shalt no longer possess anything, and shalt die to
          thyself</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">.</span>

          strong an impression on her soul that she aspired after this; but
          being a maid of eighteen years only, she was afraid of unlucky
          chances, and was never used to travel, and knew no way. She laid
          aside all these doubts and said,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Lord, thou wilt guide me how and where it shall
          please thee. It is for thee that I do it. I will lay aside my habit
          of a maid, and will take that of a hermit that I may pass
          unknown.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">Having then secretly made ready this
          habit, while her parents thought to have married her, her father
          having promised her to a rich French merchant, she prevented the
          time, and on Easter evening, having cut her hair, put on the habit,
          and slept a little, she went out of her chamber</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg 323]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg323"/><span style="font-size: 90%">about four

          is thy faith? in a penny?</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">she threw it away, begging pardon of God for her

          she went away wholly delivered from the heavy burthen of the cares
          and good things of this world, and found her soul so satisfied that
          she no longer wished for anything upon earth, resting entirely upon
          God, with this only fear lest she should be discovered and be
          obliged to return home; for she felt already more content in this
          poverty than she had done for all her life in all the delights of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Over and above the
        mystery of self-surrender, there are in the cult of poverty other
        religious mysteries. There is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg 324]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg324"/> the mystery of veracity: <span class="tei tei-q">“Naked came I into the world,”</span> etc.,—whoever first
        said that, possessed this mystery. My own bare entity must fight the
        battle—shams cannot save me. There is also the mystery of democracy,
        or sentiment of the equality before God of all his creatures. This
        sentiment (which seems in general to have been more widespread in
        Mohammedan than in Christian lands) tends to nullify man's usual
        acquisitiveness. Those who have it spurn dignities and honors,
        privileges and advantages, preferring, as I said in a former lecture,
        to grovel on the common level before the face of God. It is not
        exactly the sentiment of humility, though it comes so close to it in
        practice. It is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">humanity</span></em>, rather, refusing to enjoy
        anything that others do not share. A profound moralist, writing of
        Christ's saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sell all thou hast and
        follow me,”</span> proceeds as follows:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Christ may have meant: If you love mankind
        absolutely you will as a result not care for any possessions
        whatever, and this seems a very likely proposition. But it is one
        thing to believe that a proposition is probably true; it is another
        thing to see it as a fact. If you loved mankind as Christ loved them,
        you would see his conclusion as a fact. It would be obvious. You
        would sell your goods, and they would be no loss to you. These
        truths, while literal to Christ, and to any mind that has Christ's
        love for mankind, become parables to lesser natures. There are in
        every generation people who, beginning innocently, with no
        predetermined intention of becoming saints, find themselves drawn
        into the vortex by their interest in helping mankind, and by the
        understanding that comes from actually doing it. The abandonment of
        their old mode of life is like dust in the balance. It is done
        gradually, incidentally, imperceptibly. Thus the whole question of
        the abandonment of luxury is no question at all, but a mere incident
        to another question, namely, the degree to which we abandon ourselves
        to the remorseless logic of our love for others.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_196" id="noteref_196" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in all these
        matters of sentiment one must have <span class="tei tei-q">“been
        there”</span> one's self in order to understand them. No American can
        ever attain to understanding the loyalty of a Briton towards his
        king, of a German towards his emperor; nor can a Briton or German
        ever understand the peace of heart of an American in having no king,
        no Kaiser, no spurious nonsense, between him and the common God of
        all. If sentiments as simple as these are mysteries which one must
        receive as gifts of birth, how much more is this the case with those
        subtler religious sentiments which we have been considering! One can
        never fathom an emotion or divine its dictates by standing outside of
        it. In the glowing hour of excitement, however, all
        incomprehensibilities are solved, and what was so enigmatical from
        without becomes transparently obvious. Each emotion obeys a logic of
        its own, and makes deductions which no other logic can draw. Piety
        and charity live in a different universe from worldly lusts and
        fears, and form another centre of energy altogether. As in a supreme
        sorrow lesser vexations may become a consolation; as a supreme love
        may turn minor sacrifices into gain; so a supreme trust may render
        common safeguards odious, and in certain glows of generous excitement
        it may appear unspeakably mean to retain one's hold of personal
        possessions. The only sound plan, if we are ourselves outside the
        pale of such emotions, is to observe as well as we are able those who
        feel them, and to record faithfully what we observe; and this, I need
        hardly say, is what I have striven to do in these last two
        descriptive lectures, which I now hope will have covered the ground
        sufficiently for our present needs.</p>

<span style="font-size: 173%">Lectures XIV And XV. The Value Of
        Saintliness.</span></h1>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have now passed
        in review the more important of the phenomena which are regarded as
        fruits of genuine religion and characteristics of men who are devout.
        To-day we have to change our attitude from that of description to
        that of appreciation; we have to ask whether the fruits in question
        can help us to judge the absolute value of what religion adds to
        human life. Were I to parody Kant, I should say that a <span class="tei tei-q">“Critique of pure Saintliness”</span> must be our
        theme.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, in turning to
        this theme, we could descend upon our subject from above like
        Catholic theologians, with our fixed definitions of man and man's
        perfection and our positive dogmas about God, we should have an easy
        time of it. Man's perfection would be the fulfillment of his end; and
        his end would be union with his Maker. That union could be pursued by
        him along three paths, active, purgative, and contemplative,
        respectively; and progress along either path would be a simple matter
        to measure by the application of a limited number of theological and
        moral conceptions and definitions. The absolute significance and
        value of any bit of religious experience we might hear of would thus
        be given almost mathematically into our hands.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If convenience
        were everything, we ought now to grieve at finding ourselves cut off
        from so admirably convenient a method as this. But we did cut
        ourselves off from it deliberately in those remarks which you
        remember we <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg
        327]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg327"/>
        made, in our first lecture, about the empirical method; and it must
        be confessed that after that act of renunciation we can never hope
        for clean-cut and scholastic results. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">We</span></em> cannot
        divide man sharply into an animal and a rational part. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">We</span></em> cannot
        distinguish natural from supernatural effects; nor among the latter
        know which are favors of God, and which are counterfeit operations of
        the demon. We have merely to collect things together without any
        special <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>
        theological system, and out of an aggregate of piecemeal judgments as
        to the value of this and that experience—judgments in which our
        general philosophic prejudices, our instincts, and our common sense
        are our only guides—decide that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on the whole</span></em> one type of religion is
        approved by its fruits, and another type condemned. <span class="tei tei-q">“On the whole,”</span>—I fear we shall never escape
        complicity with that qualification, so dear to your practical man, so
        repugnant to your systematizer!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I also fear that
        as I make this frank confession, I may seem to some of you to throw
        our compass overboard, and to adopt caprice as our pilot. Skepticism
        or wayward choice, you may think, can be the only results of such a
        formless method as I have taken up. A few remarks in deprecation of
        such an opinion, and in farther explanation of the empiricist
        principles which I profess, may therefore appear at this point to be
        in place.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Abstractly, it
        would seem illogical to try to measure the worth of a religion's
        fruits in merely human terms of value. How <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></em> you
        measure their worth without considering whether the God really exists
        who is supposed to inspire them? If he really exists, then all the
        conduct instituted by men to meet his wants must necessarily be a
        reasonable fruit of his religion,—it would be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg328"/> unreasonable only in case he did not
        exist. If, for instance, you were to condemn a religion of human or
        animal sacrifices by virtue of your subjective sentiments, and if all
        the while a deity were really there demanding such sacrifices, you
        would be making a theoretical mistake by tacitly assuming that the
        deity must be non-existent; you would be setting up a theology of
        your own as much as if you were a scholastic philosopher.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this extent, to
        the extent of disbelieving peremptorily in certain types of deity, I
        frankly confess that we must be theologians. If disbeliefs can be
        said to constitute a theology, then the prejudices, instincts, and
        common sense which I chose as our guides make theological partisans
        of us whenever they make certain beliefs abhorrent.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But such
        common-sense prejudices and instincts are themselves the fruit of an
        empirical evolution. Nothing is more striking than the secular
        alteration that goes on in the moral and religious tone of men, as
        their insight into nature and their social arrangements progressively
        develop. After an interval of a few generations the mental climate
        proves unfavorable to notions of the deity which at an earlier date
        were perfectly satisfactory: the older gods have fallen below the
        common secular level, and can no longer be believed in. To-day a
        deity who should require bleeding sacrifices to placate him would be
        too sanguinary to be taken seriously. Even if powerful historical
        credentials were put forward in his favor, we would not look at them.
        Once, on the contrary, his cruel appetites were of themselves
        credentials. They positively recommended him to men's imaginations in
        ages when such coarse signs of power were respected and no others
        could be understood. Such deities then were worshiped because such
        fruits were relished.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg
        329]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg329"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Doubtless historic
        accidents always played some later part, but the original factor in
        fixing the figure of the gods must always have been psychological.
        The deity to whom the prophets, seers, and devotees who founded the
        particular cult bore witness was worth something to them personally.
        They could use him. He guided their imagination, warranted their
        hopes, and controlled their will,—or else they required him as a
        safeguard against the demon and a curber of other people's crimes. In
        any case, they chose him for the value of the fruits he seemed to
        them to yield. So soon as the fruits began to seem quite worthless;
        so soon as they conflicted with indispensable human ideals, or
        thwarted too extensively other values; so soon as they appeared
        childish, contemptible, or immoral when reflected on, the deity grew
        discredited, and was erelong neglected and forgotten. It was in this
        way that the Greek and Roman gods ceased to be believed in by
        educated pagans; it is thus that we ourselves judge of the Hindu,
        Buddhist, and Mohammedan theologies; Protestants have so dealt with
        the Catholic notions of deity, and liberal Protestants with older
        Protestant notions; it is thus that Chinamen judge of us, and that
        all of us now living will be judged by our descendants. When we cease
        to admire or approve what the definition of a deity implies, we end
        by deeming that deity incredible.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Few historic
        changes are more curious than these mutations of theological opinion.
        The monarchical type of sovereignty was, for example, so ineradicably
        planted in the mind of our own forefathers that a dose of cruelty and
        arbitrariness in their deity seems positively to have been required
        by their imagination. They called the cruelty <span class="tei tei-q">“retributive justice,”</span> and a God without it would
        certainly have struck them as not <span class="tei tei-q">“sovereign”</span> enough. But <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg 330]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg330"/> to-day we abhor the very notion of eternal
        suffering inflicted; and that arbitrary dealing-out of salvation and
        damnation to selected individuals, of which Jonathan Edwards could
        persuade himself that he had not only a conviction, but a
        <span class="tei tei-q">“delightful conviction,”</span> as of a
        doctrine <span class="tei tei-q">“exceeding pleasant, bright, and
        sweet,”</span> appears to us, if sovereignly anything, sovereignly
        irrational and mean. Not only the cruelty, but the paltriness of
        character of the gods believed in by earlier centuries also strikes
        later centuries with surprise. We shall see examples of it from the
        annals of Catholic saintship which make us rub our Protestant eyes.
        Ritual worship in general appears to the modern transcendentalist, as
        well as to the ultra-puritanic type of mind, as if addressed to a
        deity of an almost absurdly childish character, taking delight in
        toy-shop furniture, tapers and tinsel, costume and mumbling and
        mummery, and finding his <span class="tei tei-q">“glory”</span>
        incomprehensibly enhanced thereby;—just as on the other hand the
        formless spaciousness of pantheism appears quite empty to ritualistic
        natures, and the gaunt theism of evangelical sects seems intolerably
        bald and chalky and bleak. Luther, says Emerson, would have cut off
        his right hand rather than nail his theses to the door at Wittenberg,
        if he had supposed that they were destined to lead to the pale
        negations of Boston Unitarianism.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far, then,
        although we are compelled, whatever may be our pretensions to
        empiricism, to employ some sort of a standard of theological
        probability of our own whenever we assume to estimate the fruits of
        other men's religion, yet this very standard has been begotten out of
        the drift of common life. It is the voice of human experience within
        us, judging and condemning all gods that stand athwart the pathway
        along which it feels itself to be advancing. Experience, if we take
        it in the largest sense, is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg
        331]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg331"/>
        thus the parent of those disbeliefs which, it was charged, were
        inconsistent with the experiential method. The inconsistency, you
        see, is immaterial, and the charge may be neglected.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we pass from
        disbeliefs to positive beliefs, it seems to me that there is not even
        a formal inconsistency to be laid against our method. The gods we
        stand by are the gods we need and can use, the gods whose demands on
        us are reinforcements of our demands on ourselves and on one another.
        What I then propose to do is, briefly stated, to test saintliness by
        common sense, to use human standards to help us decide how far the
        religious life commends itself as an ideal kind of human activity. If
        it commends itself, then any theological beliefs that may inspire it,
        in so far forth will stand accredited. If not, then they will be
        discredited, and all without reference to anything but human working
        principles. It is but the elimination of the humanly unfit, and the
        survival of the humanly fittest, applied to religious beliefs; and if
        we look at history candidly and without prejudice, we have to admit
        that no religion has ever in the long run established or proved
        itself in any other way. Religions have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">approved</span></em>
        themselves; they have ministered to sundry vital needs which they
        found reigning. When they violated other needs too strongly, or when
        other faiths came which served the same needs better, the first
        religions were supplanted.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The needs were
        always many, and the tests were never sharp. So the reproach of
        vagueness and subjectivity and <span class="tei tei-q">“on the
        whole”</span>-ness, which can with perfect legitimacy be addressed to
        the empirical method as we are forced to use it, is after all a
        reproach to which the entire life of man in dealing with these
        matters is obnoxious. No religion has ever yet owed its prevalence to
        <span class="tei tei-q">“apodictic <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg332"/> certainty.”</span> In a later lecture I will
        ask whether objective certainty can ever be added by theological
        reasoning to a religion that already empirically prevails.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One word, also,
        about the reproach that in following this sort of an empirical method
        we are handing ourselves over to systematic skepticism.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since it is
        impossible to deny secular alterations in our sentiments and needs,
        it would be absurd to affirm that one's own age of the world can be
        beyond correction by the next age. Skepticism cannot, therefore, be
        ruled out by any set of thinkers as a possibility against which their
        conclusions are secure; and no empiricist ought to claim exemption
        from this universal liability. But to admit one's liability to
        correction is one thing, and to embark upon a sea of wanton doubt is
        another. Of willfully playing into the hands of skepticism we cannot
        be accused. He who acknowledges the imperfectness of his instrument,
        and makes allowance for it in discussing his observations, is in a
        much better position for gaining truth than if he claimed his
        instrument to be infallible. Or is dogmatic or scholastic theology
        less doubted in point of fact for claiming, as it does, to be in
        point of right undoubtable? And if not, what command over truth would
        this kind of theology really lose if, instead of absolute certainty,
        she only claimed reasonable probability for her conclusions? If
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we</span></em> claim only reasonable
        probability, it will be as much as men who love the truth can ever at
        any given moment hope to have within their grasp. Pretty surely it
        will be more than we could have had, if we were unconscious of our
        liability to err.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless,
        dogmatism will doubtless continue to condemn us for this confession.
        The mere outward form of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg
        333]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg333"/>
        inalterable certainty is so precious to some minds that to renounce
        it explicitly is for them out of the question. They will claim it
        even where the facts most patently pronounce its folly. But the safe
        thing is surely to recognize that all the insights of creatures of a
        day like ourselves must be provisional. The wisest of critics is an
        altering being, subject to the better insight of the morrow, and
        right at any moment, only <span class="tei tei-q">“up to date”</span>
        and <span class="tei tei-q">“on the whole.”</span> When larger ranges
        of truth open, it is surely best to be able to open ourselves to
        their reception, unfettered by our previous pretensions. <span class="tei tei-q">“Heartily know, when half-gods go, the gods
        arrive.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fact of
        diverse judgments about religious phenomena is therefore entirely
        unescapable, whatever may be one's own desire to attain the
        irreversible. But apart from that fact, a more fundamental question
        awaits us, the question whether men's opinions ought to be expected
        to be absolutely uniform in this field. Ought all men to have the
        same religion? Ought they to approve the same fruits and follow the
        same leadings? Are they so like in their inner needs that, for hard
        and soft, for proud and humble, for strenuous and lazy, for
        healthy-minded and despairing, exactly the same religious incentives
        are required? Or are different functions in the organism of humanity
        allotted to different types of man, so that some may really be the
        better for a religion of consolation and reassurance, whilst others
        are better for one of terror and reproof? It might conceivably be so;
        and we shall, I think, more and more suspect it to be so as we go on.
        And if it be so, how can any possible judge or critic help being
        biased in favor of the religion by which his own needs are best met?
        He aspires to impartiality; but he is too close to the struggle not
        to be to some degree a participant, and he is sure to approve
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg334"/> most warmly those fruits of
        piety in others which taste most good and prove most nourishing to
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">him</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I am well aware of
        how anarchic much of what I say may sound. Expressing myself thus
        abstractly and briefly, I may seem to despair of the very notion of
        truth. But I beseech you to reserve your judgment until we see it
        applied to the details which lie before us. I do indeed disbelieve
        that we or any other mortal men can attain on a given day to
        absolutely incorrigible and unimprovable truth about such matters of
        fact as those with which religions deal. But I reject this dogmatic
        ideal not out of a perverse delight in intellectual instability. I am
        no lover of disorder and doubt as such. Rather do I fear to lose
        truth by this pretension to possess it already wholly. That we can
        gain more and more of it by moving always in the right direction, I
        believe as much as any one, and I hope to bring you all to my way of
        thinking before the termination of these lectures. Till then, do not,
        I pray you, harden your minds irrevocably against the empiricism
        which I profess.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I will waste no

        immediately to use it upon the facts.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In critically
        judging of the value of religious phenomena, it is very important to
        insist on the distinction between religion as an individual personal
        function, and religion as an institutional, corporate, or tribal
        product. I drew this distinction, you may remember, in my second
        lecture. The word <span class="tei tei-q">“religion,”</span> as
        ordinarily used, is equivocal. A survey of history shows us that, as
        a rule, religious geniuses attract disciples, and produce groups of
        sympathizers. When these groups get strong enough to <span class="tei tei-q">“organize”</span> themselves, they become ecclesiastical
        institutions <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg
        335]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg335"/>
        with corporate ambitions of their own. The spirit of politics and the
        lust of dogmatic rule are then apt to enter and to contaminate the
        originally innocent thing; so that when we hear the word <span class="tei tei-q">“religion”</span> nowadays, we think inevitably of some
        <span class="tei tei-q">“church”</span> or other; and to some persons
        the word <span class="tei tei-q">“church”</span> suggests so much
        hypocrisy and tyranny and meanness and tenacity of superstition that
        in a wholesale undiscerning way they glory in saying that they are
        <span class="tei tei-q">“down”</span> on religion altogether. Even we
        who belong to churches do not exempt other churches than our own from
        the general condemnation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in this course
        of lectures ecclesiastical institutions hardly concern us at all. The
        religious experience which we are studying is that which lives itself
        out within the private breast. First-hand individual experience of
        this kind has always appeared as a heretical sort of innovation to
        those who witnessed its birth. Naked comes it into the world and
        lonely; and it has always, for a time at least, driven him who had it
        into the wilderness, often into the literal wilderness out of doors,
        where the Buddha, Jesus, Mohammed, St. Francis, George Fox, and so
        many others had to go. George Fox expresses well this isolation; and
        I can do no better at this point than read to you a page from his
        Journal, referring to the period of his youth when religion began to
        ferment within him seriously.</p>

          taking leave of father and mother, and all other relations, and
          traveled up and down as a stranger on the earth, which way the Lord
          inclined my heart; taking a chamber to myself in the town where I
          came, and tarrying sometimes more, sometimes less in a place: for I
          durst not stay long in a place, being afraid both of professor and
          profane, lest, being a tender young man, I should be hurt by
          conversing much with either. For which reason I kept much as a
          stranger, seeking heavenly wisdom and getting knowledge from the
          Lord; and was brought off from outward things, to rely on the Lord
          alone. As I had forsaken the priests, so I left the separate
          preachers also, and those called the most experienced people; for I
          saw there was none among them all that could speak to my condition.
          And when all my hopes in them and in all men were gone so that I
          had nothing outwardly to help me, nor could tell what to do; then,
          oh then, I heard a voice which said,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">There is one, even Jesus Christ, that can speak to
          thy condition.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">When I
          heard it, my heart did leap for joy. Then the Lord let me see why
          there was none upon the earth that could speak to my condition. I
          had not fellowship with any people, priests, nor professors, nor
          any sort of separated people. I was afraid of all carnal talk and
          talkers, for I could see nothing but corruptions. When I was in the
          deep, under all shut up, I could not believe that I should ever
          overcome; my troubles, my sorrows, and my temptations were so great
          that I often thought I should have despaired, I was so tempted. But
          when Christ opened to me how he was tempted by the same devil, and
          had overcome him, and had bruised his head; and that through him
          and his power, life, grace, and spirit, I should overcome also, I
          had confidence in him. If I had had a king's diet, palace, and
          attendance, all would have been as nothing; for nothing gave me
          comfort but the Lord by his power. I saw professors, priests, and
          people were whole and at ease in that condition which was my
          misery, and they loved that which I would have been rid of. But the
          Lord did stay my desires upon himself, and my care was cast upon
          him alone.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_197" id="noteref_197" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A genuine
        first-hand religious experience like this is bound to be a heterodoxy
        to its witnesses, the prophet appearing as a mere lonely madman. If
        his doctrine prove contagious enough to spread to any others, it
        becomes a definite and labeled heresy. But if it then still prove
        contagious enough to triumph over persecution, it becomes itself an
        orthodoxy; and when a religion has become an orthodoxy, its day of
        inwardness is over: the spring is dry; the faithful live at second
        hand exclusively and stone the prophets in their turn. The new
        church, in spite of whatever human goodness it may foster, can be
        henceforth counted on as a staunch ally in every attempt to stifle
        the spontaneous religious spirit, and to stop all later bubblings of
        the fountain from which in purer days it drew its own supply of
        inspiration. Unless, indeed, by adopting new movements of the spirit
        it can make capital out of them and use them for its selfish
        corporate designs! Of protective action of this politic sort,
        promptly or tardily decided on, the dealings of the Roman
        ecclesiasticism with many individual saints and prophets yield
        examples enough for our instruction.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The plain fact is
        that men's minds are built, as has been often said, in water-tight
        compartments. Religious after a fashion, they yet have many other
        things in them beside their religion, and unholy entanglements and
        associations inevitably obtain. The basenesses so commonly charged to
        religion's account are thus, almost all of them, not chargeable at
        all to religion proper, but rather to religion's wicked practical
        partner, the spirit of corporate dominion. And the bigotries are most
        of them in their turn chargeable to religion's wicked intellectual
        partner, the spirit of dogmatic dominion, the passion for laying down
        the law in the form of an absolutely closed-in theoretic system. The
        ecclesiastical spirit in general is the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg338"/> sum of these two spirits of dominion; and I
        beseech you never to confound the phenomena of mere tribal or
        corporate psychology which it presents with those manifestations of
        the purely interior life which are the exclusive object of our study.
        The baiting of Jews, the hunting of Albigenses and Waldenses, the
        stoning of Quakers and ducking of Methodists, the murdering of
        Mormons and the massacring of Armenians, express much rather that
        aboriginal human neophobia, that pugnacity of which we all share the
        vestiges, and that inborn hatred of the alien and of eccentric and
        non-conforming men as aliens, than they express the positive piety of
        the various perpetrators. Piety is the mask, the inner force is
        tribal instinct. You believe as little as I do, in spite of the
        Christian unction with which the German emperor addressed his troops
        upon their way to China, that the conduct which he suggested, and in
        which other Christian armies went beyond them, had anything whatever
        to do with the interior religious life of those concerned in the
        performance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Well, no more for
        past atrocities than for this atrocity should we make piety
        responsible. At most we may blame piety for not availing to check our
        natural passions, and sometimes for supplying them with hypocritical
        pretexts. But hypocrisy also imposes obligations, and with the
        pretext usually couples some restriction; and when the passion gust
        is over, the piety may bring a reaction of repentance which the
        irreligious natural man would not have shown.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For many of the
        historic aberrations which have been laid to her charge, religion as
        such, then, is not to blame. Yet of the charge that over-zealousness
        or fanaticism is one of her liabilities we cannot wholly acquit her,
        so I will next make a remark upon that point. But I will <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg 339]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg339"/> preface it by a preliminary remark which
        connects itself with much that follows.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our survey of the
        phenomena of saintliness has unquestionably produced in your minds an
        impression of extravagance. Is it necessary, some of you have asked,
        as one example after another came before us, to be quite so
        fantastically good as that? We who have no vocation for the extremer
        ranges of sanctity will surely be let off at the last day if our
        humility, asceticism, and devoutness prove of a less convulsive sort.
        This practically amounts to saying that much that it is legitimate to
        admire in this field need nevertheless not be imitated, and that
        religious phenomena, like all other human phenomena, are subject to
        the law of the golden mean. Political reformers accomplish their
        successive tasks in the history of nations by being blind for the
        time to other causes. Great schools of art work out the effects which
        it is their mission to reveal, at the cost of a one-sidedness for
        which other schools must make amends. We accept a John Howard, a
        Mazzini, a Botticelli, a Michael Angelo, with a kind of indulgence.
        We are glad they existed to show us that way, but we are glad there
        are also other ways of seeing and taking life. So of many of the
        saints whom we have looked at. We are proud of a human nature that
        could be so passionately extreme, but we shrink from advising others
        to follow the example. The conduct we blame ourselves for not
        following lies nearer to the middle line of human effort. It is less
        dependent on particular beliefs and doctrines. It is such as wears
        well in different ages, such as under different skies all judges are
        able to commend.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fruits of
        religion, in other words, are, like all human products, liable to
        corruption by excess. Common <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg340"/> sense must judge them. It need not blame the
        votary; but it may be able to praise him only conditionally, as one
        who acts faithfully according to his lights. He shows us heroism in
        one way, but the unconditionally good way is that for which no
        indulgence need be asked.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We find that error
        by excess is exemplified by every saintly virtue. Excess, in human
        faculties, means usually one-sidedness or want of balance; for it is
        hard to imagine an essential faculty too strong, if only other
        faculties equally strong be there to coöperate with it in action.
        Strong affections need a strong will; strong active powers need a
        strong intellect; strong intellect needs strong sympathies, to keep
        life steady. If the balance exist, no one faculty can possibly be too
        strong—we only get the stronger all-round character. In the life of
        saints, technically so called, the spiritual faculties are strong,
        but what gives the impression of extravagance proves usually on
        examination to be a relative deficiency of intellect. Spiritual
        excitement takes pathological forms whenever other interests are too
        few and the intellect too narrow. We find this exemplified by all the
        saintly attributes in turn—devout love of God, purity, charity,
        asceticism, all may lead astray. I will run over these virtues in
        succession.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First of all let
        us take Devoutness. When unbalanced, one of its vices is called
        Fanaticism. Fanaticism (when not a mere expression of ecclesiastical
        ambition) is only loyalty carried to a convulsive extreme. When an
        intensely loyal and narrow mind is once grasped by the feeling that a
        certain superhuman person is worthy of its exclusive devotion, one of
        the first things that happens is that it idealizes the devotion
        itself. To adequately realize the merits of the idol gets to be
        considered the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg
        341]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg341"/> one
        great merit of the worshiper; and the sacrifices and servilities by
        which savage tribesmen have from time immemorial exhibited their
        faithfulness to chieftains are now outbid in favor of the deity.
        Vocabularies are exhausted and languages altered in the attempt to
        praise him enough; death is looked on as gain if it attract his
        grateful notice; and the personal attitude of being his devotee
        becomes what one might almost call a new and exalted kind of
        professional specialty within the tribe.<a href="#note_198" id="noteref_198" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a> The
        legends that gather round the lives of holy persons are fruits of
        this impulse to celebrate and glorify. The Buddha<a href="#note_199" id="noteref_199" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a> and
        Mohammed<a href="#note_200" id="noteref_200" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">200</span></span></a> and
        their companions and many Christian saints are incrusted with a heavy
        jewelry <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg 342]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg342"/> of anecdotes which are
        meant to be honorific, but are simply <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">abgeschmackt</span></span> and silly, and form a
        touching expression of man's misguided propensity to praise.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An immediate
        consequence of this condition of mind is jealousy for the deity's
        honor. How can the devotee show his loyalty better than by
        sensitiveness in this regard? The slightest affront or neglect must
        be resented, the deity's enemies must be put to shame. In exceedingly
        narrow minds and active wills, such a care may become an engrossing
        preoccupation; and crusades have been preached and massacres
        instigated for no other reason than to remove a fancied slight upon
        the God. Theologies representing the gods as mindful of their glory,
        and churches with imperialistic policies, have conspired to fan this
        temper to a glow, so that intolerance and persecution have come to be
        vices associated by some of us inseparably with the saintly mind.
        They are unquestionably its besetting sins. The saintly temper is a
        moral temper, and a moral temper has often to be cruel. It is a
        partisan temper, and that is cruel. Between his own and Jehovah's
        enemies a David knows no difference; a Catherine of Siena, panting to
        stop the warfare among Christians which was the scandal of her epoch,
        can think of no better method of union among them than a crusade to
        massacre the Turks; Luther finds no word of protest or regret over
        the atrocious tortures with which the Anabaptist leaders were put to
        death; and a Cromwell praises the Lord for delivering his enemies
        into his hands for <span class="tei tei-q">“execution.”</span>
        Politics come in in all such cases; but piety finds the partnership
        not quite unnatural. So, when <span class="tei tei-q">“freethinkers”</span> tell us that religion and
        fanaticism are twins, we cannot make an unqualified denial of the
        charge.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fanaticism must
        then be inscribed on the wrong side <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg343"/> of religion's account, so long as the religious
        person's intellect is on the stage which the despotic kind of God
        satisfies. But as soon as the God is represented as less intent on
        his own honor and glory, it ceases to be a danger.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fanaticism is
        found only where the character is masterful and aggressive. In gentle
        characters, where devoutness is intense and the intellect feeble, we
        have an imaginative absorption in the love of God to the exclusion of
        all practical human interests, which, though innocent enough, is too
        one-sided to be admirable. A mind too narrow has room but for one
        kind of affection. When the love of God takes possession of such a
        mind, it expels all human loves and human uses. There is no English
        name for such a sweet excess of devotion, so I will refer to it as a
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">theopathic</span></em> condition.</p>

          and loved by him to distraction [aimé jusqù'à la folie]!—Margaret
          melted away with love at the thought of such a thing. Like Saint
          Philip of Neri in former times, or like Saint Francis Xavier, she
          said to God:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Hold back, O

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">The most signal proofs of God's love which
          Margaret Mary received were her hallucinations of sight, touch, and

          unable longer to contain the flames of his love for mankind, he had
          chosen her by a miracle to spread the knowledge of them. He
          thereupon took out her mortal heart, placed it inside of his own

        what were its good fruits for Margaret Mary's life? Apparently little

        more incapable of attending to external duties. They tried her in the

        devotion were without bounds, and her charity rose to acts of such a

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg345"/><span style="font-size: 90%">of them. They tried her in the kitchen, but were
          forced to give it up as hopeless—everything dropped out of her
          hands. The admirable humility with which she made amends for her
          clumsiness could not prevent this from being prejudicial to the
          order and regularity which must always reign in a community. They
          put her in the school, where the little girls cherished her, and
          cut pieces out of her clothes [for relics] as if she were already a
          saint, but where she was too absorbed inwardly to pay the necessary
          attention. Poor dear sister, even less after her visions than
          before them was she a denizen of earth, and they had to leave her
          in her heaven.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_203" id="noteref_203" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">203</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Poor dear sister,
        indeed! Amiable and good, but so feeble of intellectual outlook that
        it would be too much to ask of us, with our Protestant and modern
        education, to feel anything but indulgent pity for the kind of
        saintship which she embodies. A lower example still of theopathic
        saintliness is that of Saint Gertrude, a Benedictine nun of the
        thirteenth century, whose <span class="tei tei-q">“Revelations,”</span> a well-known mystical authority,
        consist mainly of proofs of Christ's partiality for her undeserving
        person. Assurances of his love, intimacies and caresses and
        compliments of the most absurd and puerile sort, addressed by Christ
        to Gertrude as an individual, form the tissue of this paltry-minded
        recital.<a href="#note_204" id="noteref_204" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">204</span></span></a> In
        reading such a narrative, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg
        346]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg346"/> we
        realize the gap between the thirteenth and the twentieth century, and
        we feel that saintliness of character may yield almost absolutely
        worthless fruits if it be associated with such inferior intellectual
        sympathies. What with science, idealism, and democracy, our own
        imagination has grown to need a God of an entirely different
        temperament from that Being interested exclusively in dealing out
        personal favors, with whom our ancestors were so contented. Smitten
        as we are with the vision of social righteousness, a God indifferent
        to everything but adulation, and full of partiality for his
        individual favorites, lacks an essential element of largeness; and
        even the best professional sainthood of former centuries, pent in as
        it is to such a conception, seems to us curiously shallow and
        unedifying.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Take Saint Teresa,
        for example, one of the ablest women, in many respects, of whose life
        we have the record. She had a powerful intellect of the practical
        order. She wrote admirable descriptive psychology, possessed a will
        equal to any emergency, great talent for politics and business, a
        buoyant disposition, and a first-rate literary style. She was
        tenaciously aspiring, and put her whole life at the service of her
        religious ideals. Yet so paltry were these, according to our present
        way of thinking, that (although I know that others have been moved
        differently) I confess that my only feeling in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg347"/> reading her has been pity that so much
        vitality of soul should have found such poor employment.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In spite of the
        sufferings which she endured, there is a curious flavor of
        superficiality about her genius. A Birmingham anthropologist, Dr.
        Jordan, has divided the human race into two types, whom he calls
        <span class="tei tei-q">“shrews”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“non-shrews”</span> respectively.<a href="#note_205" id="noteref_205" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">205</span></span></a> The
        shrew-type is defined as possessing an <span class="tei tei-q">“active unimpassioned temperament.”</span> In other
        words, shrews are the <span class="tei tei-q">“motors,”</span> rather
        than the <span class="tei tei-q">“sensories,”</span><a href="#note_206" id="noteref_206" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">206</span></span></a> and
        their expressions are as a rule more energetic than the feelings
        which appear to prompt them. Saint Teresa, paradoxical as such a
        judgment may sound, was a typical shrew, in this sense of the term.
        The bustle of her style, as well as of her life, proves it. Not only
        must she receive unheard-of personal favors and spiritual graces from
        her Saviour, but she must immediately write about them and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exploiter</span></em>
        them professionally, and use her expertness to give instruction to
        those less privileged. Her voluble egotism; her sense, not of radical
        bad being, as the really contrite have it, but of her <span class="tei tei-q">“faults”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“imperfections”</span> in the plural; her stereotyped
        humility and return upon herself, as covered with <span class="tei tei-q">“confusion”</span> at each new manifestation of God's
        singular partiality for a person so unworthy, are typical of
        shrewdom: a paramountly feeling nature would be objectively lost in
        gratitude, and silent. She had some public instincts, it is true; she
        hated the Lutherans, and longed for the church's triumph over them;
        but in the main her idea of religion seems to have been that of an
        endless amatory flirtation—if one may say so without
        irreverence—between <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg
        348]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg348"/> the
        devotee and the deity; and apart from helping younger nuns to go in
        this direction by the inspiration of her example and instruction,
        there is absolutely no human use in her, or sign of any general human
        interest. Yet the spirit of her age, far from rebuking her, exalted
        her as superhuman.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have to pass a
        similar judgment on the whole notion of saintship based on merits.
        Any God who, on the one hand, can care to keep a pedantically minute
        account of individual shortcomings, and on the other can feel such
        partialities, and load particular creatures with such insipid marks
        of favor, is too small-minded a God for our credence. When Luther, in
        his immense manly way, swept off by a stroke of his hand the very
        notion of a debit and credit account kept with individuals by the
        Almighty, he stretched the soul's imagination and saved theology from
        puerility.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So much for mere
        devotion, divorced from the intellectual conceptions which might
        guide it towards bearing useful human fruit.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next saintly
        virtue in which we find excess is Purity. In theopathic characters,
        like those whom we have just considered, the love of God must not be
        mixed with any other love. Father and mother, sisters, brothers, and
        friends are felt as interfering distractions; for sensitiveness and
        narrowness, when they occur together, as they often do, require above
        all things a simplified world to dwell in. Variety and confusion are
        too much for their powers of comfortable adaptation. But whereas your
        aggressive pietist reaches his unity objectively, by forcibly
        stamping disorder and divergence out, your retiring pietist reaches
        his subjectively, leaving disorder in the world at large, but making
        a smaller world in which he dwells <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg349"/> himself and from which he eliminates it
        altogether. Thus, alongside of the church militant with its prisons,
        dragonnades, and inquisition methods, we have the church <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">fugient</span></span>, as one might call it,
        with its hermitages, monasteries, and sectarian organizations, both
        churches pursuing the same object—to unify the life,<a href="#note_207" id="noteref_207" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">207</span></span></a> and
        simplify the spectacle presented to the soul. A mind extremely
        sensitive to inner discords will drop one external relation after
        another, as interfering with the absorption of consciousness in
        spiritual things. Amusements must go first, then conventional
        <span class="tei tei-q">“society,”</span> then business, then family
        duties, until at last seclusion, with a subdivision of the day into
        hours for stated religious acts, is the only thing that can be borne.
        The lives of saints are a history of successive renunciations of
        complication, one form of contact with the outer life being dropped
        after another, to save the purity of inner tone.<a href="#note_208" id="noteref_208" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">208</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Is it not better,”</span> a young sister
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg350"/> asks her Superior,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“that I should not speak at all during the
        hour of recreation, so as not to run the risk, by speaking, of
        falling into some sin of which I might not be
        conscious?”</span><a href="#note_209" id="noteref_209" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">209</span></span></a> If the
        life remains a social one at all, those who take part in it must
        follow one identical rule. Embosomed in this monotony, the zealot for
        purity feels clean and free once more. The minuteness of uniformity
        maintained in certain sectarian communities, whether monastic or not,
        is something almost inconceivable to a man of the world. Costume,
        phraseology, hours, and habits are absolutely stereotyped, and there
        is no doubt that some persons are so made as to find in this
        stability an incomparable kind of mental rest.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have no time to
        multiply examples, so I will let the case of Saint Louis of Gonzaga
        serve as a type of excess in purification. I think you will agree
        that this youth carried the elimination of the external and
        discordant to a point which we cannot unreservedly admire. At the age
        of ten, his biographer says:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">The inspiration came to him to consecrate to the
        Mother of God his own virginity—that being to her the most agreeable
        of possible presents. Without delay, then, and with all the fervor
        there was in him, joyous of heart, and burning with love, he made his
        vow of perpetual chastity. Mary accepted the offering of his innocent
        heart, and obtained for him from God, as a recompense, the
        extraordinary grace of never feeling during his entire life the
        slightest touch of temptation against the virtue of purity. This was
        an altogether exceptional favor, rarely accorded even to Saints
        themselves, and all the more marvelous in that Louis dwelt always in
        courts and among great folks, where danger and opportunity are so
        unusually frequent. It is true that Louis from his earliest childhood
        had shown a natural repugnance for whatever might be impure or</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg351"/><span style="font-size: 90%">unvirginal, and even for relations of any sort
          whatever between persons of opposite sex. But this made it all the
          more surprising that he should, especially since this vow, feel it
          necessary to have recourse to such a number of expedients for
          protecting against even the shadow of danger the virginity which he
          had thus consecrated. One might suppose that if any one could have
          contented himself with the ordinary precautions, prescribed for all
          Christians, it would assuredly have been he. But no! In the use of
          preservatives and means of defense, in flight from the most
          insignificant occasions, from every possibility of peril, just as
          in the mortification of his flesh, he went farther than the
          majority of saints. He, who by an extraordinary protection of God's
          grace was never tempted, measured all his steps as if he were
          threatened on every side by particular dangers. Thenceforward he
          never raised his eyes, either when walking in the streets, or when
          in society. Not only did he avoid all business with females even
          more scrupulously than before, but he renounced all conversation
          and every kind of social recreation with them, although his father
          tried to make him take part; and he commenced only too early to
          deliver his innocent body to austerities of every
          kind.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_210" id="noteref_210" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">210</span></span></a></p>

        like to be alone with his own mother, whether at table or in
        conversation; and when the rest of the company withdrew, he sought
        also a pretext for retiring.... Several great ladies, relatives of

        monk that if any one asked him the number of his brothers and
        sisters, he had to reflect and count them over before replying. A
        Father asked him one day if he were never troubled by the thought of
        his family, to which, <span class="tei tei-q">“I never think of them
        except when praying for them,”</span> was his only answer. Never was
        he seen to hold in his hand a flower or anything perfumed, that he
        might take pleasure in it. On the contrary, in the hospital, he used
        to seek for whatever was most disgusting, and eagerly snatch the
        bandages of ulcers, etc., from the hands of his companions. He
        avoided worldly talk, and immediately tried to turn every
        conversation on to pious subjects, or else he remained silent. He
        systematically refused to notice his surroundings. Being ordered one
        day to bring a book from the rector's seat in the refectory, he had
        to ask where the rector sat, for in the three months he had eaten
        bread there, so carefully did he guard his eyes that he had not
        noticed the place. One day, during recess, having looked by chance on
        one of his companions, he reproached himself as for a grave sin
        against modesty. He cultivated silence, as preserving from sins of
        the tongue; and his greatest penance was the limit which his
        superiors set to his bodily penances. He sought after <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg353"/> false accusations and unjust reprimands
        as opportunities of humility; and such was his obedience that, when a
        room-mate, having no more paper, asked him for a sheet, he did not
        feel free to give it to him without first obtaining the permission of
        the superior, who, as such, stood in the place of God, and
        transmitted his orders.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I can find no
        other sorts of fruit than these of Louis's saintship. He died in
        1591, in his twenty-ninth year, and is known in the Church as the
        patron of all young people. On his festival, the altar in the chapel
        devoted to him in a certain church in Rome <span class="tei tei-q">“is embosomed in flowers, arranged with exquisite taste;
        and a pile of letters may be seen at its foot, written to the Saint
        by young men and women, and directed to <span class="tei tei-q">‘Paradiso.’</span> They are supposed to be burnt unread
        except by San Luigi, who must find singular petitions in these pretty
        little missives, tied up now with a green ribbon, expressive of hope,
        now with a red one, emblematic of love,”</span> etc.<a href="#note_212" id="noteref_212" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">212</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg354"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our final judgment
        of the worth of such a life as this will depend largely on our
        conception of God, and of the sort of conduct he is best pleased with
        in his creatures. The Catholicism of the sixteenth century paid
        little heed to social righteousness; and to leave the world to the
        devil whilst saving one's own soul was then accounted no
        discreditable scheme. To-day, rightly or wrongly, helpfulness in
        general human affairs is, in consequence of one of those secular
        mutations in moral sentiment of which I spoke, deemed an essential
        element of worth in character; and to be of some public or private
        use is also reckoned as a species of divine service. Other early
        Jesuits, especially the missionaries among them, the Xaviers,
        Brébeufs, Jogues, were objective minds, and fought in their way for
        the world's welfare; so their lives to-day inspire us. But when the
        intellect, as in this Louis, is originally no larger than a pin's
        head, and cherishes ideas of God of corresponding smallness, the
        result, notwithstanding the heroism put forth, is on the whole
        repulsive. Purity, we see in the object-lesson, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> the
        one thing needful; and it is better that a life should contract many
        a dirt-mark, than forfeit usefulness in its efforts to remain
        unspotted.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Proceeding onwards
        in our search of religious extravagance, we next come upon excesses
        of Tenderness and Charity. Here saintliness has to face the charge of
        preserving the unfit, and breeding parasites and beggars.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Resist not evil,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Love your enemies,”</span> these are saintly maxims of
        which men of this world find it hard to speak without impatience. Are
        the men of this world right, or are the saints in possession of the
        deeper range of truth?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No simple answer
        is possible. Here, if anywhere, one feels the complexity of the moral
        life, and the mysteriousness of the way in which facts and ideals are
        interwoven.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perfect conduct is
        a relation between three terms: the actor, the objects for which he
        acts, and the recipients of the action. In order that conduct should
        be abstractly perfect, all three terms, intention, execution, and
        reception, should be suited to one another. The best intention will
        fail if it either work by false means or address itself to the wrong
        recipient. Thus no critic or estimator of the value of conduct can
        confine himself to the actor's animus alone, apart from the other
        elements of the performance. As there is no worse lie than a truth
        misunderstood by those who hear it, so reasonable arguments,
        challenges to magnanimity, and appeals to sympathy or justice, are
        folly when we are dealing with human crocodiles and boa-constrictors.
        The saint may simply give the universe into the hands of the enemy by
        his trustfulness. He may by non-resistance cut off his own
        survival.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Herbert Spencer
        tells us that the perfect man's conduct will appear perfect only when
        the environment is perfect: to no inferior environment is it suitably
        adapted. We may paraphrase this by cordially admitting that
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg356"/> saintly conduct would be the
        most perfect conduct conceivable in an environment where all were
        saints already; but by adding that in an environment where few are
        saints, and many the exact reverse of saints, it must be ill adapted.
        We must frankly confess, then, using our empirical common sense and
        ordinary practical prejudices, that in the world that actually is,
        the virtues of sympathy, charity, and non-resistance may be, and
        often have been, manifested in excess. The powers of darkness have
        systematically taken advantage of them. The whole modern scientific
        organization of charity is a consequence of the failure of simply
        giving alms. The whole history of constitutional government is a
        commentary on the excellence of resisting evil, and when one cheek is
        smitten, of smiting back and not turning the other cheek also.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">You will agree to
        this in general, for in spite of the Gospel, in spite of Quakerism,
        in spite of Tolstoi, you believe in fighting fire with fire, in
        shooting down usurpers, locking up thieves, and freezing out
        vagabonds and swindlers.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And yet you are
        sure, as I am sure, that were the world confined to these
        hard-headed, hard-hearted, and hard-fisted methods exclusively, were
        there no one prompt to help a brother first, and find out afterwards
        whether he were worthy; no one willing to drown his private wrongs in
        pity for the wronger's person; no one ready to be duped many a time
        rather than live always on suspicion; no one glad to treat
        individuals passionately and impulsively rather than by general rules
        of prudence; the world would be an infinitely worse place than it is
        now to live in. The tender grace, not of a day that is dead, but of a
        day yet to be born somehow, with the golden rule grown natural, would
        be cut out from the perspective of our imaginations.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg357"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The saints,
        existing in this way, may, with their extravagances of human
        tenderness, be prophetic. Nay, innumerable times they have proved
        themselves prophetic. Treating those whom they met, in spite of the
        past, in spite of all appearances, as worthy, they have stimulated
        them to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">be</span></em> worthy, miraculously transformed
        them by their radiant example and by the challenge of their
        expectation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this point of
        view we may admit the human charity which we find in all saints, and
        the great excess of it which we find in some saints, to be a
        genuinely creative social force, tending to make real a degree of
        virtue which it alone is ready to assume as possible. The saints are
        authors, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">auctores</span></span>, increasers, of goodness.
        The potentialities of development in human souls are unfathomable. So
        many who seemed irretrievably hardened have in point of fact been
        softened, converted, regenerated, in ways that amazed the subjects
        even more than they surprised the spectators, that we never can be
        sure in advance of any man that his salvation by the way of love is
        hopeless. We have no right to speak of human crocodiles and
        boa-constrictors as of fixedly incurable beings. We know not the
        complexities of personality, the smouldering emotional fires, the
        other facets of the character-polyhedron, the resources of the
        subliminal region. St. Paul long ago made our ancestors familiar with
        the idea that every soul is virtually sacred. Since Christ died for
        us all without exception, St. Paul said, we must despair of no one.
        This belief in the essential sacredness of every one expresses itself
        to-day in all sorts of humane customs and reformatory institutions,
        and in a growing aversion to the death penalty and to brutality in
        punishment. The saints, with their extravagance of human tenderness,
        are the great torch-bearers of this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg358"/> belief, the tip of the wedge, the clearers of
        the darkness. Like the single drops which sparkle in the sun as they
        are flung far ahead of the advancing edge of a wave-crest or of a
        flood, they show the way and are forerunners. The world is not yet
        with them, so they often seem in the midst of the world's affairs to
        be preposterous. Yet they are impregnators of the world, vivifiers
        and animaters of potentialities of goodness which but for them would
        lie forever dormant. It is not possible to be quite as mean as we
        naturally are, when they have passed before us. One fire kindles
        another; and without that over-trust in human worth which they show,
        the rest of us would lie in spiritual stagnancy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Momentarily
        considered, then, the saint may waste his tenderness and be the dupe
        and victim of his charitable fever, but the general function of his
        charity in social evolution is vital and essential. If things are
        ever to move upward, some one must be ready to take the first step,
        and assume the risk of it. No one who is not willing to try charity,
        to try non-resistance as the saint is always willing, can tell
        whether these methods will or will not succeed. When they do succeed,
        they are far more powerfully successful than force or worldly
        prudence. Force destroys enemies; and the best that can be said of
        prudence is that it keeps what we already have in safety. But
        non-resistance, when successful, turns enemies into friends; and
        charity regenerates its objects. These saintly methods are, as I
        said, creative energies; and genuine saints find in the elevated
        excitement with which their faith endows them an authority and
        impressiveness which makes them irresistible in situations where men
        of shallower nature cannot get on at all without the use of worldly
        prudence. This practical proof that worldly wisdom may be safely
        transcended is the saint's <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg
        359]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg359"/>
        magic gift to mankind.<a href="#note_213" id="noteref_213" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">213</span></span></a> Not
        only does his vision of a better world console us for the generally
        prevailing prose <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg
        360]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg360"/> and
        barrenness; but even when on the whole we have to confess him ill
        adapted, he makes some converts, and the environment gets better for
        his ministry. He is an effective ferment of goodness, a slow
        transmuter of the earthly into a more heavenly order.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this respect
        the Utopian dreams of social justice in which many contemporary
        socialists and anarchists indulge are, in spite of their
        impracticability and non-adaptation to present environmental
        conditions, analogous to the saint's belief in an existent kingdom of
        heaven. They help to break the edge of the general reign of hardness,
        and are slow leavens of a better order.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next topic in
        order is Asceticism, which I fancy you are all ready to consider
        without argument a virtue liable to extravagance and excess. The
        optimism and refinement of the modern imagination has, as I have
        already said elsewhere, changed the attitude of the church towards
        corporeal mortification, and a Suso or a Saint Peter of
        Alcantara<a href="#note_214" id="noteref_214" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">214</span></span></a> appear
        to us to-day rather in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg
        361]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg361"/>
        light of tragic mountebanks than of sane men inspiring us with
        respect. If the inner dispositions are right, we ask, what need of
        all this torment, this violation of the outer nature? It keeps the
        outer nature too important. Any one who is genuinely emancipated from
        the flesh will look on pleasures and pains, abundance and privation,
        as alike irrelevant and indifferent. He can engage in actions and
        experience enjoyments without fear of corruption or enslavement. As
        the Bhagavad-Gita says, only those need renounce worldly actions who
        are still inwardly attached thereto. If one be really unattached to
        the fruits of action, one may mix in the world with equanimity. I
        quoted in a former lecture Saint Augustine's antinomian saying: If
        you only love God enough, you may safely follow all your
        inclinations. <span class="tei tei-q">“He needs no devotional
        practices,”</span> is one of Ramakrishna's maxims, <span class="tei tei-q">“whose heart is moved to tears at the mere mention of the
        name of Hari.”</span><a href="#note_215" id="noteref_215" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">215</span></span></a> And the
        Buddha, in pointing out what he called <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        middle way”</span> to his disciples, told them to abstain from both
        extremes, excessive mortification being as unreal and unworthy as
        mere desire and pleasure. The only perfect life, he said, is that of
        inner wisdom, which makes one thing as indifferent to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg362"/> us as another, and thus leads to rest, to
        peace, and to Nirvâna.<a href="#note_216" id="noteref_216" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">216</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We find
        accordingly that as ascetic saints have grown older, and directors of
        conscience more experienced, they usually have shown a tendency to
        lay less stress on special bodily mortifications. Catholic teachers
        have always professed the rule that, since health is needed for
        efficiency in God's service, health must not be sacrificed to
        mortification. The general optimism and healthy-mindedness of liberal
        Protestant circles to-day makes mortification for mortification's
        sake repugnant to us. We can no longer sympathize with cruel deities,
        and the notion that God can take delight in the spectacle of
        sufferings self-inflicted in his honor is abhorrent. In consequence
        of all these motives you probably are disposed, unless some special
        utility can be shown in some individual's discipline, to treat the
        general tendency to asceticism as pathological.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet I believe that
        a more careful consideration of the whole matter, distinguishing
        between the general good intention of asceticism and the uselessness
        of some of the particular acts of which it may be guilty, ought to
        rehabilitate it in our esteem. For in its spiritual meaning
        asceticism stands for nothing less than for the essence of the
        twice-born philosophy. It symbolizes, lamely enough no doubt, but
        sincerely, the belief that there is an element of real wrongness in
        this world, which is neither to be ignored nor evaded, but which must
        be squarely met and overcome by an appeal to the soul's heroic
        resources, and neutralized and cleansed away by suffering. As against
        this view, the ultra-optimistic form of the once-born philosophy
        thinks we may treat evil by the method of ignoring. Let a man who, by
        fortunate health and circumstances, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg363"/> escapes the suffering of any great amount of
        evil in his own person, also close his eyes to it as it exists in the
        wider universe outside his private experience, and he will be quit of
        it altogether, and can sail through life happily on a healthy-minded
        basis. But we saw in our lectures on melancholy how precarious this
        attempt necessarily is. Moreover it is but for the individual; and
        leaves the evil outside of him, unredeemed and unprovided for in his
        philosophy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No such attempt
        can be a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">general</span></em> solution of the problem; and
        to minds of sombre tinge, who naturally feel life as a tragic
        mystery, such optimism is a shallow dodge or mean evasion. It
        accepts, in lieu of a real deliverance, what is a lucky personal
        accident merely, a cranny to escape by. It leaves the general world
        unhelped and still in the clutch of Satan. The real deliverance, the
        twice-born folk insist, must be of universal application. Pain and
        wrong and death must be fairly met and overcome in higher excitement,
        or else their sting remains essentially unbroken. If one has ever
        taken the fact of the prevalence of tragic death in this world's
        history fairly into his mind,—freezing, drowning, entombment alive,
        wild beasts, worse men, and hideous diseases,—he can with difficulty,
        it seems to me, continue his own career of worldly prosperity without
        suspecting that he may all the while not be really inside the game,
        that he may lack the great initiation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Well, this is
        exactly what asceticism thinks; and it voluntarily takes the
        initiation. Life is neither farce nor genteel comedy, it says, but
        something we must sit at in mourning garments, hoping its bitter
        taste will purge us of our folly. The wild and the heroic are indeed
        such rooted parts of it that healthy-mindedness pure and simple, with
        its sentimental optimism, can hardly be regarded <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg 364]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg364"/> by any thinking man as a serious
        solution. Phrases of neatness, cosiness, and comfort can never be an
        answer to the sphinx's riddle.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these remarks I
        am leaning only upon mankind's common instinct for reality, which in
        point of fact has always held the world to be essentially a theatre
        for heroism. In heroism, we feel, life's supreme mystery is hidden.
        We tolerate no one who has no capacity whatever for it in any
        direction. On the other hand, no matter what a man's frailties
        otherwise may be, if he be willing to risk death, and still more if
        he suffer it heroically, in the service he has chosen, the fact
        consecrates him forever. Inferior to ourselves in this or that way,
        if yet we cling to life, and he is able <span class="tei tei-q">“to
        fling it away like a flower”</span> as caring nothing for it, we
        account him in the deepest way our born superior. Each of us in his
        own person feels that a high-hearted indifference to life would
        expiate all his shortcomings.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The metaphysical
        mystery, thus recognized by common sense, that he who feeds on death
        that feeds on men possesses life supereminently and excellently, and
        meets best the secret demands of the universe, is the truth of which
        asceticism has been the faithful champion. The folly of the cross, so
        inexplicable by the intellect, has yet its indestructible vital
        meaning.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Representatively,
        then, and symbolically, and apart from the vagaries into which the
        unenlightened intellect of former times may have let it wander,
        asceticism must, I believe, be acknowledged to go with the profounder
        way of handling the gift of existence. Naturalistic optimism is mere
        syllabub and flattery and sponge-cake in comparison. The practical
        course of action for us, as religious men, would therefore, it seems
        to me, not be simply to turn our backs upon the ascetic impulse, as
        most of us to-day <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg

        turn them, but rather to discover some outlet for it of which the
        fruits in the way of privation and hardship might be objectively
        useful. The older monastic asceticism occupied itself with pathetic
        futilities, or terminated in the mere egotism of the individual,
        increasing his own perfection.<a href="#note_217" id="noteref_217" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">217</span></span></a> But is
        it not possible for us to discard most of these older forms of
        mortification, and yet find saner channels for the heroism which
        inspired them?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Does not, for
        example, the worship of material luxury and wealth, which constitutes
        so large a portion of the <span class="tei tei-q">“spirit”</span> of
        our age, make somewhat for effeminacy and unmanliness? Is not the
        exclusively sympathetic and facetious way in which most children are
        brought up to-day—so different from the education of a hundred years
        ago, especially in evangelical circles—in danger, in spite of its
        many advantages, of developing a certain trashiness of fibre? Are
        there not hereabouts some points of application for a renovated and
        revised ascetic discipline?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many of you would
        recognize such dangers, but would point to athletics, militarism, and
        individual and national enterprise and adventure as the remedies.
        These contemporary ideals are quite as remarkable for the energy with
        which they make for heroic standards of life, as contemporary
        religion is remarkable for the way in which it neglects them.<a href="#note_218" id="noteref_218" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">218</span></span></a> War and
        adventure assuredly keep all who engage in them from treating
        themselves too tenderly. They demand such incredible efforts, depth
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg 366]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg366"/> beyond depth of exertion, both
        in degree and in duration, that the whole scale of motivation alters.
        Discomfort and annoyance, hunger and wet, pain and cold, squalor and
        filth, cease to have any deterrent operation whatever. Death turns
        into a commonplace matter, and its usual power to check our action
        vanishes. With the annulling of these customary inhibitions, ranges
        of new energy are set free, and life seems cast upon a higher plane
        of power.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The beauty of war
        in this respect is that it is so congruous with ordinary human
        nature. Ancestral evolution has made us all potential warriors; so
        the most insignificant individual, when thrown into an army in the
        field, is weaned from whatever excess of tenderness towards his
        precious person he may bring with him, and may easily develop into a
        monster of insensibility.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But when we
        compare the military type of self-severity with that of the ascetic
        saint, we find a world-wide difference in all their spiritual
        concomitants.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Live and let
        live,’</span> ”</span> writes a clear-headed Austrian officer,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“is no device for an army. Contempt for one's
        own comrades, for the troops of the enemy, and, above all, fierce
        contempt for one's own person, are what war demands of every one. Far
        better is it for an army to be too savage, too cruel, too barbarous,
        than to possess too much sentimentality and human reasonableness. If
        the soldier is to be good for anything as a soldier, he must be
        exactly the opposite of a reasoning and thinking man. The measure of
        goodness in him is his possible use in war. War, and even peace,
        require of the soldier absolutely peculiar standards of morality. The
        recruit brings with him common moral notions, of which he must seek
        immediately to get rid. For him victory, success, must be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">everything</span></em>. The most barbaric
        tendencies <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg
        367]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg367"/> in
        men come to life again in war, and for war's uses they are
        incommensurably good.”</span><a href="#note_219" id="noteref_219" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">219</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These words are of
        course literally true. The immediate aim of the soldier's life is, as
        Moltke said, destruction, and nothing but destruction; and whatever
        constructions wars result in are remote and non-military.
        Consequently the soldier cannot train himself to be too feelingless
        to all those usual sympathies and respects, whether for persons or
        for things, that make for conservation. Yet the fact remains that war
        is a school of strenuous life and heroism; and, being in the line of
        aboriginal instinct, is the only school that as yet is universally
        available. But when we gravely ask ourselves whether this wholesale
        organization of irrationality and crime be our only bulwark against
        effeminacy, we stand aghast at the thought, and think more kindly of
        ascetic religion. One hears of the mechanical equivalent of heat.
        What we now need to discover in the social realm is the moral
        equivalent of war: something heroic that will speak to men as
        universally as war does, and yet will be as compatible with their
        spiritual selves as war has proved itself to be incompatible. I have
        often thought that in the old monkish poverty-worship, in spite of
        the pedantry which infested it, there might be something like that
        moral equivalent of war which we are seeking. May not voluntarily
        accepted poverty be <span class="tei tei-q">“the strenuous
        life,”</span> without the need of crushing weaker peoples?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Poverty indeed
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> the strenuous life,—without brass
        bands or uniforms or hysteric popular applause or lies or
        circumlocutions; and when one sees the way in which wealth-getting
        enters as an ideal into the very bone and marrow of our generation,
        one wonders whether a revival <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg 368]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg368"/> of the belief that poverty is a worthy
        religious vocation may not be <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        transformation of military courage,”</span> and the spiritual reform
        which our time stands most in need of.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among us
        English-speaking peoples especially do the praises of poverty need
        once more to be boldly sung. We have grown literally afraid to be
        poor. We despise any one who elects to be poor in order to simplify
        and save his inner life. If he does not join the general scramble and
        pant with the money-making street, we deem him spiritless and lacking
        in ambition. We have lost the power even of imagining what the
        ancient idealization of poverty could have meant: the liberation from
        material attachments, the unbribed soul, the manlier indifference,
        the paying our way by what we are or do and not by what we have, the
        right to fling away our life at any moment irresponsibly,—the more
        athletic trim, in short, the moral fighting shape. When we of the
        so-called better classes are scared as men were never scared in
        history at material ugliness and hardship; when we put off marriage
        until our house can be artistic, and quake at the thought of having a
        child without a bank-account and doomed to manual labor, it is time
        for thinking men to protest against so unmanly and irreligious a
        state of opinion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is true that so
        far as wealth gives time for ideal ends and exercise to ideal
        energies, wealth is better than poverty and ought to be chosen. But
        wealth does this in only a portion of the actual cases. Elsewhere the
        desire to gain wealth and the fear to lose it are our chief breeders
        of cowardice and propagators of corruption. There are thousands of
        conjunctures in which a wealth-bound man must be a slave, whilst a
        man for whom poverty has no terrors becomes a freeman. Think of the
        strength which personal indifference to poverty would <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg 369]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg369"/> give us if we were devoted to unpopular
        causes. We need no longer hold our tongues or fear to vote the
        revolutionary or reformatory ticket. Our stocks might fall, our hopes
        of promotion vanish, our salaries stop, our club doors close in our
        faces; yet, while we lived, we would imperturbably bear witness to
        the spirit, and our example would help to set free our generation.
        The cause would need its funds, but we its servants would be potent
        in proportion as we personally were contented with our poverty.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I recommend this
        matter to your serious pondering, for it is certain that the
        prevalent fear of poverty among the educated classes is the worst
        moral disease from which our civilization suffers.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have now said
        all that I can usefully say about the several fruits of religion as
        they are manifested in saintly lives, so I will make a brief review
        and pass to my more general conclusions.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our question, you
        will remember, is as to whether religion stands approved by its
        fruits, as these are exhibited in the saintly type of character.
        Single attributes of saintliness may, it is true, be temperamental
        endowments, found in non-religious individuals. But the whole group
        of them forms a combination which, as such, is religious, for it
        seems to flow from the sense of the divine as from its psychological
        centre. Whoever possesses strongly this sense comes naturally to
        think that the smallest details of this world derive infinite
        significance from their relation to an unseen divine order. The
        thought of this order yields him a superior denomination of
        happiness, and a steadfastness of soul with which no other can
        compare. In social relations his serviceability is exemplary; he
        abounds in impulses to help. His help is inward <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg 370]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg370"/> as well as outward, for his sympathy
        reaches souls as well as bodies, and kindles unsuspected faculties
        therein. Instead of placing happiness where common men place it, in
        comfort, he places it in a higher kind of inner excitement, which
        converts discomforts into sources of cheer and annuls unhappiness. So
        he turns his back upon no duty, however thankless; and when we are in
        need of assistance, we can count upon the saint lending his hand with
        more certainty than we can count upon any other person. Finally, his
        humble-mindedness and his ascetic tendencies save him from the petty
        personal pretensions which so obstruct our ordinary social
        intercourse, and his purity gives us in him a clean man for a
        companion. Felicity, purity, charity, patience, self-severity,—these
        are splendid excellencies, and the saint of all men shows them in the
        completest possible measure.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, as we saw,
        all these things together do not make saints infallible. When their
        intellectual outlook is narrow, they fall into all sorts of holy
        excesses, fanaticism or theopathic absorption, self-torment, prudery,
        scrupulosity, gullibility, and morbid inability to meet the world. By
        the very intensity of his fidelity to the paltry ideals with which an
        inferior intellect may inspire him, a saint can be even more
        objectionable and damnable than a superficial carnal man would be in
        the same situation. We must judge him not sentimentally only, and not
        in isolation, but using our own intellectual standards, placing him
        in his environment, and estimating his total function.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now in the matter
        of intellectual standards, we must bear in mind that it is unfair,
        where we find narrowness of mind, always to impute it as a vice to
        the individual, for in religious and theological matters he probably
        absorbs his narrowness from his generation. Moreover, we <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg371"/> must not confound the essentials of
        saintliness, which are those general passions of which I have spoken,
        with its accidents, which are the special determinations of these
        passions at any historical moment. In these determinations the saints
        will usually be loyal to the temporary idols of their tribe. Taking
        refuge in monasteries was as much an idol of the tribe in the middle
        ages, as bearing a hand in the world's work is to-day. Saint Francis
        or Saint Bernard, were they living to-day, would undoubtedly be
        leading consecrated lives of some sort, but quite as undoubtedly they
        would not lead them in retirement. Our animosity to special historic
        manifestations must not lead us to give away the saintly impulses in
        their essential nature to the tender mercies of inimical critics.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most inimical
        critic of the saintly impulses whom I know is Nietzsche. He contrasts
        them with the worldly passions as we find these embodied in the
        predaceous military character, altogether to the advantage of the
        latter. Your born saint, it must be confessed, has something about
        him which often makes the gorge of a carnal man rise, so it will be
        worth while to consider the contrast in question more fully.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dislike of the
        saintly nature seems to be a negative result of the biologically
        useful instinct of welcoming leadership, and glorifying the chief of
        the tribe. The chief is the potential, if not the actual tyrant, the
        masterful, overpowering man of prey. We confess our inferiority and
        grovel before him. We quail under his glance, and are at the same
        time proud of owning so dangerous a lord. Such instinctive and
        submissive hero-worship must have been indispensable in primeval
        tribal life. In the endless wars of those times, leaders were
        absolutely needed for the tribe's survival. If there were any tribes
        who owned no leaders, they can have left no <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg 372]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg372"/> issue to narrate their doom. The leaders always
        had good consciences, for conscience in them coalesced with will, and
        those who looked on their face were as much smitten with wonder at
        their freedom from inner restraint as with awe at the energy of their
        outward performances.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Compared with
        these beaked and taloned graspers of the world, saints are
        herbivorous animals, tame and harmless barn-yard poultry. There are
        saints whose beard you may, if you ever care to, pull with impunity.
        Such a man excites no thrills of wonder veiled in terror; his
        conscience is full of scruples and returns; he stuns us neither by
        his inward freedom nor his outward power; and unless he found within
        us an altogether different faculty of admiration to appeal to, we
        should pass him by with contempt.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In point of fact,
        he does appeal to a different faculty. Reënacted in human nature is
        the fable of the wind, the sun, and the traveler. The sexes embody
        the discrepancy. The woman loves the man the more admiringly the
        stormier he shows himself, and the world deifies its rulers the more
        for being willful and unaccountable. But the woman in turn subjugates
        the man by the mystery of gentleness in beauty, and the saint has
        always charmed the world by something similar. Mankind is susceptible
        and suggestible in opposite directions, and the rivalry of influences
        is unsleeping. The saintly and the worldly ideal pursue their feud in
        literature as much as in real life.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For Nietzsche the
        saint represents little but sneakingness and slavishness. He is the
        sophisticated invalid, the degenerate <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">par
        excellence</span></span>, the man of insufficient vitality. His
        prevalence would put the human type in danger.</p>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Poor Nietzsche's
        antipathy is itself sickly enough, but we all know what he means, and
        he expresses well the clash between the two ideals. The
        carnivorous-minded <span class="tei tei-q">“strong man,”</span> the
        adult male and cannibal, can see nothing but mouldiness and
        morbidness in the saint's gentleness and self-severity, and regards
        him with pure loathing. The whole feud revolves essentially upon two
        pivots: Shall the seen world or the unseen world be our chief sphere
        of adaptation? and must our means of adaptation in this seen world be
        aggressiveness or non-resistance?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg 374]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg374"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The debate is
        serious. In some sense and to some degree both worlds must be
        acknowledged and taken account of; and in the seen world both
        aggressiveness and non-resistance are needful. It is a question of
        emphasis, of more or less. Is the saint's type or the strong-man's
        type the more ideal?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has often been
        supposed, and even now, I think, it is supposed by most persons, that
        there can be one intrinsically ideal type of human character. A
        certain kind of man, it is imagined, must be the best man absolutely
        and apart from the utility of his function, apart from economical
        considerations. The saint's type, and the knight's or gentleman's
        type, have always been rival claimants of this absolute ideality; and
        in the ideal of military religious orders both types were in a manner
        blended. According to the empirical philosophy, however, all ideals
        are matters of relation. It would be absurd, for example, to ask for
        a definition of <span class="tei tei-q">“the ideal horse,”</span> so
        long as dragging drays and running races, bearing children, and
        jogging about with tradesmen's packages all remain as indispensable
        differentiations of equine function. You may take what you call a
        general all-round animal as a compromise, but he will be inferior to
        any horse of a more specialized type, in some one particular
        direction. We must not forget this now when, in discussing
        saintliness, we ask if it be an ideal type of manhood. We must test
        it by its economical relations.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I think that the
        method which Mr. Spencer uses in his Data of Ethics will help to fix
        our opinion. Ideality in conduct is altogether a matter of
        adaptation. A society where all were invariably aggressive would
        destroy itself by inner friction, and in a society where some are
        aggressive, others must be non-resistant, if there is to be any kind
        of order. This is the present constitution of society, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg375"/> and to the mixture we owe many of our
        blessings. But the aggressive members of society are always tending
        to become bullies, robbers, and swindlers; and no one believes that
        such a state of things as we now live in is the millennium. It is
        meanwhile quite possible to conceive an imaginary society in which
        there should be no aggressiveness, but only sympathy and
        fairness,—any small community of true friends now realizes such a
        society. Abstractly considered, such a society on a large scale would
        be the millennium, for every good thing might be realized there with
        no expense of friction. To such a millennial society the saint would
        be entirely adapted. His peaceful modes of appeal would be
        efficacious over his companions, and there would be no one extant to
        take advantage of his non-resistance. The saint is therefore
        abstractly a higher type of man than the <span class="tei tei-q">“strong man,”</span> because he is adapted to the highest
        society conceivable, whether that society ever be concretely possible
        or not. The strong man would immediately tend by his presence to make
        that society deteriorate. It would become inferior in everything save
        in a certain kind of bellicose excitement, dear to men as they now
        are.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if we turn
        from the abstract question to the actual situation, we find that the
        individual saint may be well or ill adapted, according to particular
        circumstances. There is, in short, no absoluteness in the excellence
        of sainthood. It must be confessed that as far as this world goes,
        any one who makes an out-and-out saint of himself does so at his
        peril. If he is not a large enough man, he may appear more
        insignificant and contemptible, for all his saintship, than if he had
        remained a worldling.<a href="#note_221" id="noteref_221" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">221</span></span></a>
        Accordingly religion has seldom been so radically <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg 376]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg376"/> taken in our Western world that the
        devotee could not mix it with some worldly temper. It has always
        found good men who could follow most of its impulses, but who stopped
        short when it came to non-resistance. Christ himself was fierce upon
        occasion. Cromwells, Stonewall Jacksons, Gordons, show that
        Christians can be strong men also.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How is success to
        be absolutely measured when there are so many environments and so
        many ways of looking at the adaptation? It cannot be measured
        absolutely; the verdict will vary according to the point of view
        adopted. From the biological point of view Saint Paul was a failure,
        because he was beheaded. Yet he was magnificently adapted to the
        larger environment of history; and so far as any saint's example is a
        leaven of righteousness in the world, and draws it in the direction
        of more prevalent habits of saintliness, he is a success, no matter
        what his immediate bad fortune may be. The greatest saints, the
        spiritual heroes whom every one acknowledges, the Francises,
        Bernards, Luthers, Loyolas, Wesleys, Channings, Moodys, Gratrys, the
        Phillips Brookses, the Agnes Joneses, Margaret Hallahans, and Dora
        Pattisons, are successes from the outset. They show themselves, and
        there is no question; every one perceives their strength and stature.
        Their sense of mystery in things, their passion, their goodness,
        irradiate about them and enlarge their outlines while they soften
        them. They are like pictures with an atmosphere and background; and,
        placed alongside of them, the strong men of this world and no other
        seem as dry as sticks, as hard and crude as blocks of stone or
        brickbats.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg
        377]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg377"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a general way,
        then, and <span class="tei tei-q">“on the whole,”</span><a href="#note_222" id="noteref_222" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">222</span></span></a> our
        abandonment of theological criteria, and our testing of religion by
        practical common sense and the empirical method, leave it in
        possession of its towering place in history. Economically, the
        saintly group of qualities is indispensable to the world's welfare.
        The great saints are immediate successes; the smaller ones are at
        least heralds and harbingers, and they may be leavens also, of a
        better mundane order. Let us be saints, then, if we can, whether or
        not we succeed visibly and temporally. But in our Father's house are
        many mansions, and each of us must discover for himself the kind of
        religion and the amount of saintship which best comports with what he
        believes to be his powers and feels to be his truest mission and
        vocation. There are no successes to be guaranteed and no set orders
        to be given to individuals, so long as we follow the methods of
        empirical philosophy.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is my
        conclusion so far. I know that on some of your minds it leaves a
        feeling of wonder that such a method should have been applied to such
        a subject, and this in spite of all those remarks about empiricism
        which I made at the beginning of Lecture <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Lecture_XI_XII_XIII">XIII</a>.<a href="#note_223" id="noteref_223" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">223</span></span></a> How,
        you say, can religion, which believes in two worlds and an invisible
        order, be estimated by the adaptation of its fruits to this world's
        order alone? It is its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">truth</span></em>, not its utility, you insist,
        upon which our verdict ought to depend. If religion is true, its
        fruits are good fruits, even though in this world they should prove
        uniformly ill adapted and full of naught but pathos. It goes back,
        then, after all, to the question of the truth of theology. The plot
        inevitably thickens upon us; we cannot escape theoretical
        considerations. I propose, then, that to some <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page378">[pg 378]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg378"/> degree we face the responsibility.
        Religious persons have often, though not uniformly, professed to see
        truth in a special manner. That manner is known as mysticism. I will
        consequently now proceed to treat at some length of mystical
        phenomena, and after that, though more briefly, I will consider
        religious philosophy.</p>

<span style="font-size: 173%">Lectures XVI And XVII.
        Mysticism.</span></h1>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Over and over
        again in these lectures I have raised points and left them open and
        unfinished until we should have come to the subject of Mysticism.
        Some of you, I fear, may have smiled as you noted my reiterated
        postponements. But now the hour has come when mysticism must be faced
        in good earnest, and those broken threads wound up together. One may
        say truly, I think, that personal religious experience has its root
        and centre in mystical states of consciousness; so for us, who in
        these lectures are treating personal experience as the exclusive
        subject of our study, such states of consciousness ought to form the
        vital chapter from which the other chapters get their light. Whether
        my treatment of mystical states will shed more light or darkness, I
        do not know, for my own constitution shuts me out from their
        enjoyment almost entirely, and I can speak of them only at second
        hand. But though forced to look upon the subject so externally, I
        will be as objective and receptive as I can; and I think I shall at
        least succeed in convincing you of the reality of the states in
        question, and of the paramount importance of their function.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First of all,
        then, I ask, What does the expression <span class="tei tei-q">“mystical states of consciousness”</span> mean? How do we
        part off mystical states from other states?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The words
        <span class="tei tei-q">“mysticism”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“mystical”</span> are often used as terms of mere
        reproach, to throw at any opinion which we regard as vague and vast
        and sentimental, and without <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg 380]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg380"/> a base in either facts or logic. For some
        writers a <span class="tei tei-q">“mystic”</span> is any person who
        believes in thought-transference, or spirit-return. Employed in this
        way the word has little value: there are too many less ambiguous
        synonyms. So, to keep it useful by restricting it, I will do what I
        did in the case of the word <span class="tei tei-q">“religion,”</span> and simply propose to you four marks
        which, when an experience has them, may justify us in calling it
        mystical for the purpose of the present lectures. In this way we
        shall save verbal disputation, and the recriminations that generally
        go therewith.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ineffability.</span></span>—The handiest of the
        marks by which I classify a state of mind as mystical is negative.
        The subject of it immediately says that it defies expression, that no
        adequate report of its contents can be given in words. It follows
        from this that its quality must be directly experienced; it cannot be
        imparted or transferred to others. In this peculiarity mystical
        states are more like states of feeling than like states of intellect.
        No one can make clear to another who has never had a certain feeling,
        in what the quality or worth of it consists. One must have musical
        ears to know the value of a symphony; one must have been in love
        one's self to understand a lover's state of mind. Lacking the heart
        or ear, we cannot interpret the musician or the lover justly, and are
        even likely to consider him weak-minded or absurd. The mystic finds
        that most of us accord to his experiences an equally incompetent
        treatment.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Noetic
        quality.</span></span>—Although so similar to states of feeling,
        mystical states seem to those who experience them to be also states
        of knowledge. They are states of insight into depths of truth
        unplumbed by the discursive intellect. They are illuminations,
        revelations, full of significance and importance, all inarticulate
        though they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg
        381]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg381"/>
        remain; and as a rule they carry with them a curious sense of
        authority for after-time.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These two
        characters will entitle any state to be called mystical, in the sense
        in which I use the word. Two other qualities are less sharply marked,
        but are usually found. These are:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Transiency.</span></span>—Mystical states cannot
        be sustained for long. Except in rare instances, half an hour, or at
        most an hour or two, seems to be the limit beyond which they fade
        into the light of common day. Often, when faded, their quality can
        but imperfectly be reproduced in memory; but when they recur it is
        recognized; and from one recurrence to another it is susceptible of
        continuous development in what is felt as inner richness and
        importance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Passivity.</span></span>—Although the oncoming
        of mystical states may be facilitated by preliminary voluntary
        operations, as by fixing the attention, or going through certain
        bodily performances, or in other ways which manuals of mysticism
        prescribe; yet when the characteristic sort of consciousness once has
        set in, the mystic feels as if his own will were in abeyance, and
        indeed sometimes as if he were grasped and held by a superior power.
        This latter peculiarity connects mystical states with certain
        definite phenomena of secondary or alternative personality, such as
        prophetic speech, automatic writing, or the mediumistic trance. When
        these latter conditions are well pronounced, however, there may be no
        recollection whatever of the phenomenon, and it may have no
        significance for the subject's usual inner life, to which, as it
        were, it makes a mere interruption. Mystical states, strictly so
        called, are never merely interruptive. Some memory of their content
        always remains, and a profound sense of their importance. They modify
        the inner life <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg
        382]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg382"/> of
        the subject between the times of their recurrence. Sharp divisions in
        this region are, however, difficult to make, and we find all sorts of
        gradations and mixtures.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These four
        characteristics are sufficient to mark out a group of states of
        consciousness peculiar enough to deserve a special name and to call
        for careful study. Let it then be called the mystical group.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our next step
        should be to gain acquaintance with some typical examples.
        Professional mystics at the height of their development have often
        elaborately organized experiences and a philosophy based thereupon.
        But you remember what I said in my first lecture: phenomena are best
        understood when placed within their series, studied in their germ and
        in their over-ripe decay, and compared with their exaggerated and
        degenerated kindred. The range of mystical experience is very wide,
        much too wide for us to cover in the time at our disposal. Yet the
        method of serial study is so essential for interpretation that if we
        really wish to reach conclusions we must use it. I will begin,
        therefore, with phenomena which claim no special religious
        significance, and end with those of which the religious pretensions
        are extreme.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The simplest
        rudiment of mystical experience would seem to be that deepened sense
        of the significance of a maxim or formula which occasionally sweeps
        over one. <span class="tei tei-q">“I've heard that said all my
        life,”</span> we exclaim, <span class="tei tei-q">“but I never
        realized its full meaning until now.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“When a fellow-monk,”</span> said Luther, <span class="tei tei-q">“one day repeated the words of the Creed: <span class="tei tei-q">‘I believe in the forgiveness of sins,’</span> I saw the
        Scripture in an entirely new light; and straightway I felt as if I
        were born anew. It was as if I had found the door of paradise thrown
        wide open.”</span><a href="#note_224" id="noteref_224" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">224</span></span></a> This
        sense <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg383"/> of deeper significance
        is not confined to rational propositions. Single words,<a href="#note_225" id="noteref_225" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">225</span></span></a> and
        conjunctions of words, effects of light on land and sea, odors and
        musical sounds, all bring it when the mind is tuned aright. Most of
        us can remember the strangely moving power of passages in certain
        poems read when we were young, irrational doorways as they were
        through which the mystery of fact, the wildness and the pang of life,
        stole into our hearts and thrilled them. The words have now perhaps
        become mere polished surfaces for us; but lyric poetry and music are
        alive and significant only in proportion as they fetch these vague
        vistas of a life continuous with our own, beckoning and inviting, yet
        ever eluding our pursuit. We are alive or dead to the eternal inner
        message of the arts according as we have kept or lost this mystical
        susceptibility.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A more pronounced
        step forward on the mystical ladder is found in an extremely frequent
        phenomenon, that sudden feeling, namely, which sometimes sweeps over
        us, of having <span class="tei tei-q">“been here before,”</span> as
        if at some indefinite past time, in just this place, with just these
        people, we were already saying just these things. As Tennyson

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sir James
        Crichton-Browne has given the technical name of <span class="tei tei-q">“dreamy states”</span> to these sudden invasions of
        vaguely reminiscent consciousness.<a href="#note_227" id="noteref_227" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a> They
        bring a sense of mystery and of the metaphysical duality of things,
        and the feeling of an enlargement of perception which seems imminent
        but which never completes itself. In Dr. Crichton-Browne's opinion
        they connect themselves with the perplexed and scared disturbances of
        self-consciousness which occasionally precede epileptic attacks. I
        think that this learned alienist takes a rather absurdly alarmist
        view of an intrinsically insignificant phenomenon. He follows it
        along the downward ladder, to insanity; our path pursues the upward
        ladder chiefly. The divergence shows how important it is to neglect
        no part of a phenomenon's connections, for we make it appear
        admirable or dreadful according to the context by which we set it
        off.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Somewhat deeper
        plunges into mystical consciousness are met with in yet other dreamy
        states. Such feelings <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg
        385]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg385"/> as

          “</span><span style="font-size: 90%">at church, or in company, or
          when I was reading, and always, I think, when my muscles were at
          rest, I felt the approach of the mood. Irresistibly it took
          possession of my mind and will, lasted what seemed an eternity, and
          disappeared in a series of rapid sensations which resembled the
          awakening from anæsthetic influence. One reason why I disliked this
          kind of trance was that I could not describe it to myself. I cannot
          even now find words to render it intelligible. It consisted in a
          gradual but swiftly progressive obliteration of space, time,
          sensation, and the multitudinous factors of experience which seem
          to qualify what we are pleased to call our Self. In proportion as
          these conditions of ordinary consciousness were subtracted, the
          sense of an underlying or essential consciousness acquired
          intensity. At last nothing remained but a pure, absolute, abstract
          Self. The universe became without form and void of content. But
          Self persisted, formidable in its vivid keenness, feeling the most
          poignant doubt about reality, ready, as it seemed, to find
          existence break as breaks a bubble round about it. And what then?
          The apprehension of a coming dissolution, the grim conviction that
          this state was the last state of the conscious Self, the sense
          that</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg
          386]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg386"/><span style="font-size: 90%">I had followed
          the last thread of being to the verge of the abyss, and had arrived
          at demonstration of eternal Maya or illusion, stirred or seemed to
          stir me up again. The return to ordinary conditions of sentient
          existence began by my first recovering the power of touch, and then
          by the gradual though rapid influx of familiar impressions and
          diurnal interests. At last I felt myself once more a human being;
          and though the riddle of what is meant by life remained unsolved, I
          was thankful for this return from the abyss—this deliverance from
          so awful an initiation into the mysteries of
          skepticism.</span></span></p>

          until I reached the age of twenty-eight. It served to impress upon
          my growing nature the phantasmal unreality of all the circumstances
          which contribute to a merely phenomenal consciousness. Often have I
          asked myself with anguish, on waking from that formless state of
          denuded, keenly sentient being, Which is the unreality?—the trance
          of fiery, vacant, apprehensive, skeptical Self from which I issue,
          or these surrounding phenomena and habits which veil that inner
          Self and build a self of flesh-and-blood conventionality? Again,
          are men the factors of some dream, the dream-like unsubstantiality
          of which they comprehend at such eventful moments? What would
          happen if the final stage of the trance were
          reached?</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_229" id="noteref_229" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">229</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a recital like
        this there is certainly something suggestive of pathology.<a href="#note_230" id="noteref_230" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">230</span></span></a> The
        next step into mystical states carries us into a realm that public
        opinion and ethical philosophy have long since branded as
        pathological, though private practice and certain lyric strains of
        poetry <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg 387]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg387"/> seem still to bear
        witness to its ideality. I refer to the consciousness produced by
        intoxicants and anæsthetics, especially by alcohol. The sway of
        alcohol over mankind is unquestionably due to its power to stimulate
        the mystical faculties of human nature, usually crushed to earth by
        the cold facts and dry criticisms of the sober hour. Sobriety
        diminishes, discriminates, and says no; drunkenness expands, unites,
        and says yes. It is in fact the great exciter of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Yes</span></em>
        function in man. It brings its votary from the chill periphery of
        things to the radiant core. It makes him for the moment one with
        truth. Not through mere perversity do men run after it. To the poor
        and the unlettered it stands in the place of symphony concerts and of
        literature; and it is part of the deeper mystery and tragedy of life
        that whiffs and gleams of something that we immediately recognize as
        excellent should be vouchsafed to so many of us only in the fleeting
        earlier phases of what in its totality is so degrading a poisoning.
        The drunken consciousness is one bit of the mystic consciousness, and
        our total opinion of it must find its place in our opinion of that
        larger whole.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nitrous oxide and
        ether, especially nitrous oxide, when sufficiently diluted with air,
        stimulate the mystical consciousness in an extraordinary degree.
        Depth beyond depth of truth seems revealed to the inhaler. This truth
        fades out, however, or escapes, at the moment of coming to; and if
        any words remain over in which it seemed to clothe itself, they prove
        to be the veriest nonsense. Nevertheless, the sense of a profound
        meaning having been there persists; and I know more than one person
        who is persuaded that in the nitrous oxide trance we have a genuine
        metaphysical revelation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some years ago I
        myself made some observations on this aspect of nitrous oxide
        intoxication, and reported <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page388">[pg
        388]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg388"/>
        them in print. One conclusion was forced upon my mind at that time,
        and my impression of its truth has ever since remained unshaken. It
        is that our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as we
        call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about
        it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential
        forms of consciousness entirely different. We may go through life
        without suspecting their existence; but apply the requisite stimulus,
        and at a touch they are there in all their completeness, definite
        types of mentality which probably somewhere have their field of
        application and adaptation. No account of the universe in its
        totality can be final which leaves these other forms of consciousness
        quite disregarded. How to regard them is the question,—for they are
        so discontinuous with ordinary consciousness. Yet they may determine
        attitudes though they cannot furnish formulas, and open a region
        though they fail to give a map. At any rate, they forbid a premature
        closing of our accounts with reality. Looking back on my own
        experiences, they all converge towards a kind of insight to which I
        cannot help ascribing some metaphysical significance. The keynote of
        it is invariably a reconciliation. It is as if the opposites of the
        world, whose contradictoriness and conflict make all our difficulties
        and troubles, were melted into unity. Not only do they, as contrasted
        species, belong to one and the same genus, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one of the
        species</span></em>, the nobler and better one, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is itself the genus,
        and so soaks up and absorbs its opposite into itself</span></em>.
        This is a dark saying, I know, when thus expressed in terms of common
        logic, but I cannot wholly escape from its authority. I feel as if it
        must mean something, something like what the Hegelian philosophy
        means, if one could only lay hold of it more clearly. Those who have
        ears to hear, let them hear; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page389">[pg 389]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg389"/> to me the living sense of its reality only

        thought that I was near death; when, suddenly, my soul became aware
        of God, who was manifestly dealing with me, handling me, so to speak,
        in an intense personal present reality. I felt him streaming in like
        light upon me.... I cannot describe the ecstasy I felt. Then, as I

        to the Unitarian Chapel in Macclesfield. I felt it impossible to
        accompany them—as though to leave the sunshine on the hills, and go
        down there to the chapel, would be for the time an act of spiritual
        suicide. And I felt such need for new inspiration and expansion in my
        life. So, very reluctantly and sadly, I left my wife and boys to go
        down into the town, while I went further up into the hills with my
        stick and my dog. In the loveliness of the morning, and the beauty of
        the hills and valleys, I soon lost my sense of sadness and regret.

          indescribably intense, accompanied with a sense of being bathed in
          a warm glow of light, as though the external condition had brought
          about the internal effect—a feeling of having passed beyond the
          body, though the scene around me stood out more clearly and as if
          nearer to me than before, by reason of the illumination in the
          midst of which I seemed to be placed. This deep emotion lasted,

        quality, and of the deep impression which they make on those who have
        them. A Canadian psychiatrist, Dr. R. M. Bucke, gives to the more
        distinctly characterized of these phenomena the name of cosmic
        consciousness. <span class="tei tei-q">“Cosmic consciousness in its
        more striking instances is not,”</span> Dr. Bucke says, <span class="tei tei-q">“simply an expansion or extension of the self-conscious
        mind with which we are all familiar, but the superaddition of a
        function as distinct from any possessed by the average man as

        a consciousness of the cosmos, that is, of the life and order of the

        intellectual enlightenment which alone would place the individual on
        a new plane of existence—would make him almost a member of a new
        species. To this is added a state of moral exaltation, an
        indescribable feeling of elevation, elation, and joyousness, and a
        quickening of the moral sense, which is fully as striking, and more
        important than is the enhanced intellectual power. With these come
        what may be called a sense of immortality, a consciousness of eternal

        friends, reading and discussing poetry and philosophy. We parted at
        midnight. I had a long drive in a hansom to my lodging. My mind,
        deeply under the influence of the ideas, images, and emotions called
        up by the reading and talk, was calm and peaceful. I was in a state
        of quiet, almost passive enjoyment, not actually thinking, but
        letting ideas, images, and emotions flow of themselves, as it were,
        through my mind. All at once, without warning of any kind, I found
        myself wrapped in a flame-colored cloud. For an instant I thought of
        fire, an immense conflagration somewhere close by in that great city;
        the next, I knew that the fire was within myself. Directly afterward
        there came upon me a sense of exultation, of immense joyousness
        accompanied or immediately followed by an intellectual illumination
        impossible to describe. Among other things, I did not merely come to
        believe, but I saw that the universe is not composed of dead matter,
        but is, on the contrary, a living Presence; I became conscious in
        myself of eternal life. It was not a conviction that I would have
        eternal life, but a consciousness that I possessed eternal life then;
        I saw that all men are immortal; that the cosmic order is such that
        without any peradventure all things work together for the good of
        each and all; that the foundation principle of the world, of all the
        worlds, is what we call love, and that the happiness of each and all
        is in the long run absolutely certain. The vision lasted a few
        seconds and was gone; but the memory of it and the sense of the
        reality of what it taught has remained during the quarter of a
        century which has since elapsed. I knew that what the vision showed
        was true. I had attained to a point of view from which I saw that it
        must be true. That view, that conviction, I may say that
        consciousness, has never, even during periods of the deepest
        depression, been lost.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_242" id="noteref_242" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">242</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In India, training
        in mystical insight has been known from time immemorial under the

        with the divine. It is based on persevering exercise; and the diet,
        posture, breathing, intellectual concentration, and moral discipline
        vary slightly in the different systems which teach it. The yogi, or
        disciple, who has by these means overcome the obscurations of his
        lower nature sufficiently, enters into the condition termed
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">samâdhi</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“and comes face to face with facts which no instinct or

        test of religion's value, is empirical: its fruits must be good for

        Hindus; but <span class="tei tei-q">“dhyâna”</span> is their special
        word for higher states of contemplation. There seem to be four stages
        recognized in dhyâna. The first stage comes through concentration of
        the mind upon one point. It excludes desire, but not discernment or
        judgment: it is still intellectual. In the second stage the
        intellectual functions drop off, and the satisfied sense of unity
        remains. In the third stage the satisfaction departs, and
        indifference begins, along with memory and self-consciousness. In the
        fourth stage the indifference, memory, and self-consciousness are
        perfected. [Just what <span class="tei tei-q">“memory”</span> and
        <span class="tei tei-q">“self-consciousness”</span> mean in this
        connection is doubtful. They cannot be the faculties familiar to us
        in the lower life.] Higher stages still of contemplation are
        mentioned—a region where there exists nothing, and where the
        meditator says: <span class="tei tei-q">“There exists absolutely
        nothing,”</span> and stops. Then he reaches another region where he
        says: <span class="tei tei-q">“There are neither ideas nor absence of
        ideas,”</span> and stops again. Then another region where,

        the mystical tradition. The Sufis have existed in Persia from the
        earliest times, and as their pantheism is so at variance with the hot
        and rigid monotheism of the Arab mind, it has been suggested that
        Sufism must have been inoculated into Islam by Hindu influences. We
        Christians know little of Sufism, for its secrets are disclosed only
        to those initiated. To give its existence a certain liveliness in
        your minds, I will quote a Moslem document, and pass away from the
        subject.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Al-Ghazzali, a
        Persian philosopher and theologian, who flourished in the eleventh
        century, and ranks as one of the greatest doctors of the Moslem
        church, has left us one of the few autobiographies to be found
        outside of Christian literature. Strange that a species of book so
        abundant among ourselves should be so little represented
        elsewhere—the absence of strictly personal confessions is the chief
        difficulty to the purely literary student who would like to become
        acquainted with the inwardness of religions other than the
        Christian.</p>

        detaching the heart from all that is not God, and at giving to it for
        sole occupation the meditation of the divine being. Theory being more
        easy for me than practice, I read [certain books] until I understood
        all that can be learned by study and</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg 403]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg403"/><span style="font-size: 90%">hearsay. Then I
          recognized that what pertains most exclusively to their method is
          just what no study can grasp, but only transport, ecstasy, and the
          transformation of the soul. How great, for example, is the
          difference between knowing the definitions of health, of satiety,
          with their causes and conditions, and being really healthy or
          filled. How different to know in what drunkenness consists,—as
          being a state occasioned by a vapor that rises from the
          stomach,—and</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">being</span></em> <span style="font-size: 90%">drunk effectively. Without doubt, the drunken man
          knows neither the definition of drunkenness nor what makes it
          interesting for science. Being drunk, he knows nothing; whilst the
          physician, although not drunk, knows well in what drunkenness
          consists, and what are its predisposing conditions. Similarly there
          is a difference between knowing the nature of abstinence,
          and</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">being</span></em> <span style="font-size: 90%">abstinent or having one's soul detached from the
          world.—Thus I had learned what words could teach of Sufism, but
          what was left could be learned neither by study nor through the
          ears, but solely by giving one's self up to ecstasy and leading a
          pious life.</span></span></p>

          down by a multitude of bonds—temptations on every side. Considering
          my teaching, I found it was impure before God. I saw myself
          struggling with all my might to achieve glory and to spread my
          name. [Here follows an account of his six months' hesitation to
          break away from the conditions of his life at Bagdad, at the end of
          which he fell ill with a paralysis of the tongue.] Then, feeling my
          own weakness, and having entirely given up my own will, I repaired
          to God like a man in distress who has no more resources. He
          answered, as he answers the wretch who invokes him. My heart no
          longer felt any difficulty in renouncing glory, wealth, and my
          children. So I quitted Bagdad, and reserving from my fortune only
          what was indispensable for my subsistence, I distributed the rest.
          I went to Syria, where I remained about two years, with no other
          occupation than living in retreat and solitude, conquering my
          desires, combating my passions, training myself to purify my soul,
          to make my character perfect, to prepare my heart for meditating on
          God—all according to the methods of the Sufis, as I had read of

          the family, the need of subsistence, changed in some respects my
          primitive resolve, and interfered with my plans for a purely
          solitary life. I had never yet found myself completely in ecstasy,
          save in a few single hours; nevertheless, I kept the hope of
          attaining this state. Every time that the accidents led me astray,
          I sought to return; and in this situation I spent ten years. During
          this solitary state things were revealed to me which it is
          impossible either to describe or to point out. I recognized for
          certain that the Sufis are assuredly walking in the path of God.
          Both in their acts and in their inaction, whether internal or
          external, they are illumined by the light which proceeds from the
          prophetic source. The first condition for a Sufi is to purge his
          heart entirely of all that is not God. The next key of the
          contemplative life consists in the humble prayers which escape from
          the fervent soul, and in the meditations on God in which the heart
          is swallowed up entirely. But in reality this is only the beginning
          of the Sufi life, the end of Sufism being total absorption in God.
          The intuitions and all that precede are, so to speak, only the
          threshold for those who enter. From the beginning, revelations take
          place in so flagrant a shape that the Sufis see before them, whilst
          wide awake, the angels and the souls of the prophets. They hear
          their voices and obtain their favors. Then the transport rises from
          the perception of forms and figures to a degree which escapes all
          expression, and which no man may seek to give an account of without
          his words involving sin.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Whoever has had no experience of the transport
          knows of the true nature of prophetism nothing but the name. He may
          meanwhile be sure of its existence, both by experience and by what
          he hears the Sufis say. As there are men endowed only with the
          sensitive faculty who reject what is offered them in the way of
          objects of the pure understanding, so there are intellectual men
          who reject and avoid the things perceived by the prophetic faculty.
          A blind man can understand nothing of colors save what he has
          learned by narration and hearsay. Yet God</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg 405]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg405"/><span style="font-size: 90%">has brought
          prophetism near to men in giving them all a state analogous to it
          in its principal characters. This state is sleep. If you were to
          tell a man who was himself without experience of such a phenomenon
          that there are people who at times swoon away so as to resemble
          dead men, and who [in dreams] yet perceive things that are hidden,
          he would deny it [and give his reasons]. Nevertheless, his
          arguments would be refuted by actual experience. Wherefore, just as
          the understanding is a stage of human life in which an eye opens to
          discern various intellectual objects uncomprehended by sensation;
          just so in the prophetic the sight is illumined by a light which
          uncovers hidden things and objects which the intellect fails to
          reach. The chief properties of prophetism are perceptible only
          during the transport, by those who embrace the Sufi life. The
          prophet is endowed with qualities to which you possess nothing
          analogous, and which consequently you cannot possibly understand.
          How should you know their true nature, since one knows only what
          one can comprehend? But the transport which one attains by the
          method of the Sufis is like an immediate perception, as if one
          touched the objects with one's hand.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_247" id="noteref_247" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">247</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This
        incommunicableness of the transport is the keynote of all mysticism.
        Mystical truth exists for the individual who has the transport, but
        for no one else. In this, as I have said, it resembles the knowledge
        given to us in sensations more than that given by conceptual thought.
        Thought, with its remoteness and abstractness, has often enough in
        the history of philosophy been contrasted unfavorably with sensation.
        It is a commonplace of metaphysics that God's knowledge cannot be
        discursive but must be intuitive, that is, must be constructed more
        after the pattern of what in ourselves is called immediate feeling,
        than after that of proposition and judgment. But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em>
        immediate feelings have no content <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg 406]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg406"/> but what the five senses supply; and we have
        seen and shall see again that mystics may emphatically deny that the
        senses play any part in the very highest type of knowledge which
        their transports yield.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Christian
        church there have always been mystics. Although many of them have
        been viewed with suspicion, some have gained favor in the eyes of the
        authorities. The experiences of these have been treated as
        precedents, and a codified system of mystical theology has been based
        upon them, in which everything legitimate finds its place.<a href="#note_248" id="noteref_248" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">248</span></span></a> The
        basis of the system is <span class="tei tei-q">“orison”</span> or
        meditation, the methodical elevation of the soul towards God. Through
        the practice of orison the higher levels of mystical experience may
        be attained. It is odd that Protestantism, especially evangelical
        Protestantism, should seemingly have abandoned everything methodical
        in this line. Apart from what prayer may lead to, Protestant mystical
        experience appears to have been almost exclusively sporadic. It has
        been left to our mind-curers to reintroduce methodical meditation
        into our religious life.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first thing to
        be aimed at in orison is the mind's detachment from outer sensations,
        for these interfere with its concentration upon ideal things. Such
        manuals as Saint Ignatius's Spiritual Exercises recommend the
        disciple to expel sensation by a graduated series of efforts to
        imagine holy scenes. The acme of this kind of discipline would be a
        semi-hallucinatory mono-ideism—an imaginary figure of Christ, for
        example, coming fully to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407">[pg
        407]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg407"/>
        occupy the mind. Sensorial images of this sort, whether literal or
        symbolic, play an enormous part in mysticism.<a href="#note_249" id="noteref_249" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">249</span></span></a> But in
        certain cases imagery may fall away entirely, and in the very highest
        raptures it tends to do so. The state of consciousness becomes then
        insusceptible of any verbal description. Mystical teachers are
        unanimous as to this. Saint John of the Cross, for instance, one of
        the best of them, thus describes the condition called the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“union of love,”</span> which, he says, is
        reached by <span class="tei tei-q">“dark contemplation.”</span> In
        this the Deity compenetrates the soul, but in such a hidden way that
        the soul—</p>

        render the sublimity of the wisdom and the delicacy of the spiritual
        feeling with which she is filled.... We receive this mystical
        knowledge of God clothed in none of the kinds of images, in none of
        the sensible representations, which our mind makes use of in other
        circumstances. Accordingly in this knowledge, since the senses and
        the imagination are not employed, we get neither form nor impression,
        nor can we give any account or furnish any likeness, although the
        mysterious and sweet-tasting wisdom comes home so clearly to the
        inmost parts of our soul. Fancy a man seeing a certain kind of thing
        for the first time in his life. He can understand it, use and enjoy
        it, but he cannot apply a name to it, nor communicate any idea of it,
        even though all the while it be a mere thing of sense. How much
        greater will be his powerlessness when it goes beyond the senses!
        This is the peculiarity of the divine language. The more infused,
        intimate, spiritual, and supersensible it is, the more does it exceed
        the senses, both inner and outer, and impose silence upon them....
        The soul then feels as if placed in a vast and profound solitude, to
        which no created thing has access, in an immense and boundless
        desert, desert the more delicious the</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg408"/><span style="font-size: 90%">more solitary it
          is. There, in this abyss of wisdom, the soul grows by what it
          drinks in from the well-springs of the comprehension of love, ...
          and recognizes, however sublime and learned may be the terms we
          employ, how utterly vile, insignificant, and improper they are,
          when we seek to discourse of divine things by their
          means.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_250" id="noteref_250" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">250</span></span></a></p>

        truth. Saint Teresa is the expert of experts in describing such

        Saint Teresa,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">the soul is
        fully awake as regards God, but wholly asleep as regards things of
        this world and in respect of herself. During the short time the union
        lasts, she is as it were deprived of every feeling, and even if she
        would, she could not think of any single thing.</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page409">[pg 409]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg409"/><span style="font-size: 90%">Thus she
        needs to employ no artifice in order to arrest the use of her
        understanding: it remains so stricken with inactivity that she
        neither knows what she loves, nor in what manner she loves, nor what
        she wills. In short, she is utterly dead to the things of the world
        and lives solely in God.... I do not even know whether in this state
        she has enough life left to breathe. It seems to me she has not; or
        at least that if she does breathe, she is unaware of it. Her
        intellect would fain understand something of what is going on within
        her, but it has so little force now that it can act in no way
        whatsoever. So a person who falls into a deep faint appears as if
        dead....</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Thus does God, when he raises a soul to union with
          himself, suspend the natural action of all her faculties. She
          neither sees, hears, nor understands, so long as she is united with
          God. But this time is always short, and it seems even shorter than
          it is. God establishes himself in the interior of this soul in such
          a way, that when she returns to herself, it is wholly impossible
          for her to doubt that she has been in God, and God in her. This
          truth remains so strongly impressed on her that, even though many
          years should pass without the condition returning, she can neither
          forget the favor she received, nor doubt of its reality. If you,
          nevertheless, ask how it is possible that the soul can see and
          understand that she has been in God, since during the union she has
          neither sight nor understanding, I reply that she does not see it
          then, but that she sees it clearly later, after she has returned to
          herself, not by any vision, but by a certitude which abides with
          her and which God alone can give her. I knew a person who was
          ignorant of the truth that God's mode of being in everything must
          be either by presence, by power, or by essence, but who, after
          having received the grace of which I am speaking, believed this
          truth in the most unshakable manner. So much so that, having
          consulted a half-learned man who was as ignorant on this point as
          she had been before she was enlightened, when he replied that God
          is in us only by</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">grace,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">she

        of the consciousness which they induce. To pass a spiritual judgment
        upon these states, we must not content ourselves with superficial
        medical talk, but inquire into their fruits for life.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Their fruits
        appear to have been various. Stupefaction, for one thing, seems not
        to have been altogether absent as a result. You may remember the
        helplessness in the kitchen and schoolroom of poor Margaret Mary
        Alacoque. Many other ecstatics would have perished but for the care
        taken of them by admiring followers. The <span class="tei tei-q">“other-worldliness”</span> encouraged by the mystical
        consciousness makes this over-abstraction from practical life
        peculiarly liable to befall mystics in whom the character is
        naturally passive and the intellect feeble; but in natively strong
        minds and characters we find quite opposite results. The great
        Spanish mystics, who carried the habit of ecstasy as far as it has
        often been carried, appear for the most part to have shown
        indomitable spirit and energy, and all the more so for the trances in
        which they indulged.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saint Ignatius was
        a mystic, but his mysticism made him assuredly one of the most
        powerfully practical human engines that ever lived. Saint John of the
        Cross, writing of the intuitions and <span class="tei tei-q">“touches”</span> by which God reaches the substance of
        the soul, tells us that—</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page414">[pg

        be sufficient to abolish at a stroke certain imperfections of which
        the soul during its whole life had vainly tried to rid itself, and to
        leave it adorned with virtues and loaded with supernatural gifts. A
        single one of these intoxicating consolations may reward it for all
        the labors undergone in its life—even were they numberless. Invested
        with an invincible courage, filled with an impassioned desire to
        suffer for its God, the soul then is seized with a strange
        torment—that of not being allowed to suffer
          enough.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_258" id="noteref_258" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">258</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saint Teresa is as
        emphatic, and much more detailed. You may perhaps remember a passage
        I quoted from her in my first lecture.<a href="#note_259" id="noteref_259" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a> There
        are many similar pages in her autobiography. Where in literature is a
        more evidently veracious account of the formation of a new centre of
        spiritual energy, than is given in her description of the effects of
        certain ecstasies which in departing leave the soul upon a higher
        level of emotional excitement?</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Often, infirm and wrought upon with dreadful pains
        before the ecstasy, the soul emerges from it full of health and
        admirably disposed for action ... as if God had willed that the body
        itself, already obedient to the soul's desires, should share in the
        soul's happiness.... The soul after such a favor is animated with a
        degree of courage so great that if at that moment its body should be
        torn to pieces for the cause of God, it would feel nothing but the
        liveliest comfort. Then it is that promises and heroic resolutions
        spring up in profusion in us, soaring desires, horror of the world,
        and the clear perception of our proper nothingness.... What empire is
        comparable to that of a soul who, from this sublime summit to which
        God has raised her, sees all the things of earth beneath her feet,
        and is captivated by no one of them? How ashamed she is of her former
        attachments! How amazed at her blindness! What lively pity she feels
        for those whom she recognizes still shrouded in the darkness!... She
        groans at having ever been sensitive</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page415">[pg 415]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg415"/><span style="font-size: 90%">to points of
          honor, at the illusion that made her ever see as honor what the
          world calls by that name. Now she sees in this name nothing more
          than an immense lie of which the world remains a victim. She
          discovers, in the new light from above, that in genuine honor there
          is nothing spurious, that to be faithful to this honor is to give
          our respect to what deserves to be respected really, and to
          consider as nothing, or as less than nothing, whatsoever perishes
          and is not agreeable to God.... She laughs when she sees grave
          persons, persons of orison, caring for points of honor for which
          she now feels profoundest contempt. It is suitable to the dignity
          of their rank to act thus, they pretend, and it makes them more
          useful to others. But she knows that in despising the dignity of
          their rank for the pure love of God they would do more good in a
          single day than they would effect in ten years by preserving it....
          She laughs at herself that there should ever have been a time in
          her life when she made any case of money, when she ever desired
          it.... Oh! if human beings might only agree together to regard it
          as so much useless mud, what harmony would then reign in the world!
          With what friendship we would all treat each other if our interest
          in honor and in money could but disappear from earth! For my own
          part, I feel as if it would be a remedy for all our
          ills.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_260" id="noteref_260" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">260</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mystical
        conditions may, therefore, render the soul more energetic in the
        lines which their inspiration favors. But this could be reckoned an
        advantage only in case the inspiration were a true one. If the
        inspiration were erroneous, the energy would be all the more mistaken
        and misbegotten. So we stand once more before that problem of truth
        which confronted us at the end of the lectures on saintliness. You
        will remember that we turned to mysticism precisely to get some light
        on truth. Do mystical states establish the truth of those theological
        affections in which the saintly life has its root?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In spite of their
        repudiation of articulate self-description, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg 416]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg416"/> mystical states in general assert a pretty
        distinct theoretic drift. It is possible to give the outcome of the
        majority of them in terms that point in definite philosophical
        directions. One of these directions is optimism, and the other is
        monism. We pass into mystical states from out of ordinary
        consciousness as from a less into a more, as from a smallness into a
        vastness, and at the same time as from an unrest to a rest. We feel
        them as reconciling, unifying states. They appeal to the yes-function
        more than to the no-function in us. In them the unlimited absorbs the
        limits and peacefully closes the account. Their very denial of every
        adjective you may propose as applicable to the ultimate truth,—He,
        the Self, the Atman, is to be described by <span class="tei tei-q">“No! no!”</span> only, say the Upanishads,<a href="#note_261" id="noteref_261" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">261</span></span></a>—though
        it seems on the surface to be a no-function, is a denial made on
        behalf of a deeper yes. Whoso calls the Absolute anything in
        particular, or says that it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>, seems implicitly to shut it
        off from being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>—it is as if he lessened it. So
        we deny the <span class="tei tei-q">“this,”</span> negating the
        negation which it seems to us to imply, in the interests of the
        higher affirmative attitude by which we are possessed. The
        fountain-head of Christian mysticism is Dionysius the Areopagite. He
        describes the absolute truth by negatives exclusively.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus come the
        paradoxical expressions that so abound in mystical writings. As when

        and is as nothing with respect to all things, forasmuch as it is not
        comprehensible by any of them. And because it is nothing
        respectively, it is therefore free from all things, and is that only
        good, which a man cannot express or utter what it is, there being
        nothing to which it may be compared, to express it by.”</span><a href="#note_265" id="noteref_265" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">265</span></span></a> Or as

        of affirmation, there is correlated the subtlest of moral
        counterparts in the sphere of the personal will. Since denial of the
        finite self and its wants, since asceticism of some sort, is found in

        brings it about that the mystical classics have, as has been said,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My next task is to

        for the truth</span></em> of the twice-bornness and supernaturality
        and pantheism which it favors? I must give my answer to this question
        as concisely as I can.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In brief my answer
        is this,—and I will divide it into three parts:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) Mystical
        states, when well developed, usually are, and have the right to be,
        absolutely authoritative over the individuals to whom they come.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) No authority
        emanates from them which should make it a duty for those who stand
        outside of them to accept their revelations
        uncritically.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page423">[pg
        423]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg423"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) They break
        down the authority of the non-mystical or rationalistic
        consciousness, based upon the understanding and the senses alone.
        They show it to be only one kind of consciousness. They open out the
        possibility of other orders of truth, in which, so far as anything in
        us vitally responds to them, we may freely continue to have
        faith.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I will take up
        these points one by one.</p>
<div class="tei tei-div" style="margin-bottom: 4.00em; margin-top: 4.00em">
<h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.88em; margin-top: 2.88em">
<span style="font-size: 144%">1.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As a matter of
          psychological fact, mystical states of a well-pronounced and
          emphatic sort <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em> usually authoritative over
          those who have them.<a href="#note_279" id="noteref_279" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">279</span></span></a> They
          have been <span class="tei tei-q">“there,”</span> and know. It is
          vain for rationalism to grumble about this. If the mystical truth
          that comes to a man proves to be a force that he can live by, what
          mandate have we of the majority to order him to live in another
          way? We can throw him into a prison or a madhouse, but we cannot
          change his mind—we commonly attach it only the more stubbornly to
          its beliefs.<a href="#note_280" id="noteref_280" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">280</span></span></a> It
          mocks our utmost efforts, as a matter of fact, and in point of
          logic it absolutely escapes our jurisdiction. Our own more
          <span class="tei tei-q">“rational”</span> beliefs are based on
          evidence exactly similar in nature to that which mystics quote for
          theirs. Our senses, namely, have assured us of certain states of
          fact; but mystical experiences are as direct perceptions
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page424">[pg 424]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg424"/> of fact for those
          who have them as any sensations ever were for us. The records show
          that even though the five senses be in abeyance in them, they are
          absolutely sensational in their epistemological quality, if I may
          be pardoned the barbarous expression,—that is, they are face to
          face presentations of what seems immediately to exist.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mystic is,
          in short, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invulnerable</span></em>, and must be left,
          whether we relish it or not, in undisturbed enjoyment of his creed.
          Faith, says Tolstoy, is that by which men live. And faith-state and
          mystic state are practically convertible terms.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">2.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But I now
          proceed to add that mystics have no right to claim that we ought to
          accept the deliverance of their peculiar experiences, if we are
          ourselves outsiders and feel no private call thereto. The utmost
          they can ever ask of us in this life is to admit that they
          establish a presumption. They form a consensus and have an
          unequivocal outcome; and it would be odd, mystics might say, if
          such a unanimous type of experience should prove to be altogether
          wrong. At bottom, however, this would only be an appeal to numbers,
          like the appeal of rationalism the other way; and the appeal to
          numbers has no logical force. If we acknowledge it, it is for
          <span class="tei tei-q">“suggestive,”</span> not for logical
          reasons: we follow the majority because to do so suits our
          life.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But even this
          presumption from the unanimity of mystics is far from being strong.
          In characterizing mystic states as pantheistic, optimistic, etc., I
          am afraid I over-simplified the truth. I did so for expository
          reasons, and to keep the closer to the classic mystical tradition.
          The classic religious mysticism, it now must be confessed,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page425">[pg 425]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg425"/> is only a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“privileged case.”</span> It is an
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extract</span></em>, kept true to type by the
          selection of the fittest specimens and their preservation in
          <span class="tei tei-q">“schools.”</span> It is carved out from a
          much larger mass; and if we take the larger mass as seriously as
          religious mysticism has historically taken itself, we find that the
          supposed unanimity largely disappears. To begin with, even
          religious mysticism itself, the kind that accumulates traditions
          and makes schools, is much less unanimous than I have allowed. It
          has been both ascetic and antinomianly self-indulgent within the
          Christian church.<a href="#note_281" id="noteref_281" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">281</span></span></a> It is
          dualistic in Sankhya, and monistic in Vedanta philosophy. I called
          it pantheistic; but the great Spanish mystics are anything but
          pantheists. They are with few exceptions non-metaphysical minds,
          for whom <span class="tei tei-q">“the category of
          personality”</span> is absolute. The <span class="tei tei-q">“union”</span> of man with God is for them much more
          like an occasional miracle than like an original identity.<a href="#note_282" id="noteref_282" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">282</span></span></a> How
          different again, apart from the happiness common to all, is the
          mysticism of Walt Whitman, Edward Carpenter, Richard Jefferies, and
          other naturalistic pantheists, from the more distinctively
          Christian sort.<a href="#note_283" id="noteref_283" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">283</span></span></a> The
          fact is that the mystical feeling of enlargement, union, and
          emancipation has no specific intellectual content whatever of its
          own. It is capable of forming matrimonial alliances with material
          furnished by the most diverse philosophies and theologies, provided
          only they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page426">[pg
          426]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg426"/>
          can find a place in their framework for its peculiar emotional
          mood. We have no right, therefore, to invoke its prestige as
          distinctively in favor of any special belief, such as that in
          absolute idealism, or in the absolute monistic identity, or in the
          absolute goodness, of the world. It is only relatively in favor of
          all these things—it passes out of common human consciousness in the
          direction in which they lie.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So much for
          religious mysticism proper. But more remains to be told, for
          religious mysticism is only one half of mysticism. The other half
          has no accumulated traditions except those which the text-books on
          insanity supply. Open any one of these, and you will find abundant
          cases in which <span class="tei tei-q">“mystical ideas”</span> are
          cited as characteristic symptoms of enfeebled or deluded states of
          mind. In delusional insanity, paranoia, as they sometimes call it,
          we may have a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">diabolical</span></em> mysticism, a sort of
          religious mysticism turned upside down. The same sense of ineffable
          importance in the smallest events, the same texts and words coming
          with new meanings, the same voices and visions and leadings and
          missions, the same controlling by extraneous powers; only this time
          the emotion is pessimistic: instead of consolations we have
          desolations; the meanings are dreadful; and the powers are enemies
          to life. It is evident that from the point of view of their
          psychological mechanism, the classic mysticism and these lower
          mysticisms spring from the same mental level, from that great
          subliminal or transmarginal region of which science is beginning to
          admit the existence, but of which so little is really known. That
          region contains every kind of matter: <span class="tei tei-q">“seraph and snake”</span> abide there side by side. To
          come from thence is no infallible credential. What comes must be
          sifted and tested, and run the gauntlet of confrontation with the
          total context of experience, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page427">[pg 427]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg427"/> just like what comes from the outer world of
          sense. Its value must be ascertained by empirical methods, so long
          as we are not mystics ourselves.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Once more, then,
          I repeat that non-mystics are under no obligation to acknowledge in
          mystical states a superior authority conferred on them by their
          intrinsic nature.<a href="#note_284" id="noteref_284" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">284</span></span></a></p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">3.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet, I repeat
          once more, the existence of mystical states absolutely overthrows
          the pretension of non-mystical states to be the sole and ultimate
          dictators of what we may believe. As a rule, mystical states merely
          add a supersensuous meaning to the ordinary outward data of
          consciousness. They are excitements like the emotions of love or
          ambition, gifts to our spirit by means of which facts already
          objectively before us fall into a new expressiveness and make a new
          connection with our active life. They do not contradict these facts
          as such, or deny anything that our senses have immediately
          seized.<a href="#note_285" id="noteref_285" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">285</span></span></a> It is
          the rationalistic critic rather who plays the part of denier in
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page428">[pg 428]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg428"/> the controversy, and
          his denials have no strength, for there never can be a state of
          facts to which new meaning may not truthfully be added, provided
          the mind ascend to a more enveloping point of view. It must always
          remain an open question whether mystical states may not possibly be
          such superior points of view, windows through which the mind looks
          out upon a more extensive and inclusive world. The difference of
          the views seen from the different mystical windows need not prevent
          us from entertaining this supposition. The wider world would in
          that case prove to have a mixed constitution like that of this
          world, that is all. It would have its celestial and its infernal
          regions, its tempting and its saving moments, its valid experiences
          and its counterfeit ones, just as our world has them; but it would
          be a wider world all the same. We should have to use its
          experiences by selecting and subordinating and substituting just as
          is our custom in this ordinary naturalistic world; we should be
          liable to error just as we are now; yet the counting in of that
          wider world of meanings, and the serious dealing with it, might, in
          spite of all the perplexity, be indispensable stages in our
          approach to the final fullness of the truth.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this shape, I
          think, we have to leave the subject. Mystical states indeed wield
          no authority due simply to their being mystical states. But the
          higher ones among them point in directions to which the religious
          sentiments even of non-mystical men incline. They tell of the
          supremacy of the ideal, of vastness, of union, of safety, and of
          rest. They offer us <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hypotheses</span></em>, hypotheses which we
          may voluntarily ignore, but which as thinkers we cannot possibly
          upset. The supernaturalism and optimism to which they would
          persuade us may, interpreted in one way or another, be after all
          the truest of insights into the meaning of this
          life.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page429">[pg

          to try to persuade you that this is the case. Meanwhile, however, I
          am sure that for many of my readers this diet is too slender. If
          supernaturalism and inner union with the divine are true, you
          think, then not so much permission, as compulsion to believe, ought
          to be found. Philosophy has always professed to prove religious
          truth by coercive argument; and the construction of philosophies of
          this kind has always been one favorite function of the religious
          life, if we use this term in the large historic sense. But
          religious philosophy is an enormous subject, and in my next lecture
          I can only give that brief glance at it which my limits will
          allow.</p>

<span style="font-size: 173%">Lecture XVIII. Philosophy.</span></h1>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The subject of
        Saintliness left us face to face with the question, Is the sense of
        divine presence a sense of anything objectively true? We turned first
        to mysticism for an answer, and found that although mysticism is
        entirely willing to corroborate religion, it is too private (and also
        too various) in its utterances to be able to claim a universal
        authority. But philosophy publishes results which claim to be
        universally valid if they are valid at all, so we now turn with our
        question to philosophy. Can philosophy stamp a warrant of veracity
        upon the religious man's sense of the divine?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I imagine that
        many of you at this point begin to indulge in guesses at the goal to
        which I am tending. I have undermined the authority of mysticism, you
        say, and the next thing I shall probably do is to seek to discredit
        that of philosophy. Religion, you expect to hear me conclude, is
        nothing but an affair of faith, based either on vague sentiment, or
        on that vivid sense of the reality of things unseen of which in my
        second lecture and in the lecture on Mysticism I gave so many
        examples. It is essentially private and individualistic; it always
        exceeds our powers of formulation; and although attempts to pour its
        contents into a philosophic mould will probably always go on, men
        being what they are, yet these attempts are always secondary
        processes which in no way add to the authority, or warrant the
        veracity, of the sentiments from which they derive their own stimulus
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page431">[pg 431]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg431"/> and borrow whatever glow of
        conviction they may themselves possess. In short, you suspect that I
        am planning to defend feeling at the expense of reason, to
        rehabilitate the primitive and unreflective, and to dissuade you from
        the hope of any Theology worthy of the name.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To a certain
        extent I have to admit that you guess rightly. I do believe that
        feeling is the deeper source of religion, and that philosophic and
        theological formulas are secondary products, like translations of a
        text into another tongue. But all such statements are misleading from
        their brevity, and it will take the whole hour for me to explain to
        you exactly what I mean.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When I call
        theological formulas secondary products, I mean that in a world in
        which no religious feeling had ever existed, I doubt whether any
        philosophic theology could ever have been framed. I doubt if
        dispassionate intellectual contemplation of the universe, apart from
        inner unhappiness and need of deliverance on the one hand and
        mystical emotion on the other, would ever have resulted in religious
        philosophies such as we now possess. Men would have begun with
        animistic explanations of natural fact, and criticised these away
        into scientific ones, as they actually have done. In the science they
        would have left a certain amount of <span class="tei tei-q">“psychical research,”</span> even as they now will
        probably have to re-admit a certain amount. But high-flying
        speculations like those of either dogmatic or idealistic theology,
        these they would have had no motive to venture on, feeling no need of
        commerce with such deities. These speculations must, it seems to me,
        be classed as over-beliefs, buildings-out performed by the intellect
        into directions of which feeling originally supplied the hint.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But even if
        religious philosophy had to have its first hint supplied by feeling,
        may it not have dealt in a superior <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page432">[pg 432]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg432"/> way with the matter which feeling suggested?
        Feeling is private and dumb, and unable to give an account of itself.
        It allows that its results are mysteries and enigmas, declines to
        justify them rationally, and on occasion is willing that they should
        even pass for paradoxical and absurd. Philosophy takes just the
        opposite attitude. Her aspiration is to reclaim from mystery and
        paradox whatever territory she touches. To find an escape from
        obscure and wayward personal persuasion to truth objectively valid
        for all thinking men has ever been the intellect's most cherished
        ideal. To redeem religion from unwholesome privacy, and to give
        public status and universal right of way to its deliverances, has
        been reason's task.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I believe that
        philosophy will always have opportunity to labor at this task.<a href="#note_286" id="noteref_286" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">286</span></span></a> We are
        thinking beings, and we cannot exclude the intellect from
        participating in any of our functions. Even in soliloquizing with
        ourselves, we construe our feelings intellectually. Both our personal
        ideals and our religious and mystical experiences must be interpreted
        congruously with the kind of scenery which our thinking mind
        inhabits. The philosophic climate of our time inevitably forces its
        own clothing on us. Moreover, we must exchange our feelings with one
        another, and in doing so we have to speak, and to use general and
        abstract verbal formulas. Conceptions and constructions are thus a
        necessary part of our religion; and as moderator amid the clash of
        hypotheses, and mediator among the criticisms of one man's
        constructions by another, philosophy will always have much to do. It
        would be strange if I disputed this, when these very lectures which I
        am giving are (as you will see more clearly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page433">[pg 433]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg433"/> from now onwards) a laborious attempt to
        extract from the privacies of religious experience some general facts
        which can be defined in formulas upon which everybody may agree.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Religious
        experience, in other words, spontaneously and inevitably engenders
        myths, superstitions, dogmas, creeds, and metaphysical theologies,
        and criticisms of one set of these by the adherents of another. Of
        late, impartial classifications and comparisons have become possible,
        alongside of the denunciations and anathemas by which the commerce
        between creeds used exclusively to be carried on. We have the
        beginnings of a <span class="tei tei-q">“Science of
        Religions,”</span> so-called; and if these lectures could ever be
        accounted a crumb-like contribution to such a science, I should be
        made very happy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But all these
        intellectual operations, whether they be constructive or comparative
        and critical, presuppose immediate experiences as their
        subject-matter. They are interpretative and inductive operations,
        operations after the fact, consequent upon religious feeling, not
        coördinate with it, not independent of what it ascertains.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
        intellectualism in religion which I wish to discredit pretends to be
        something altogether different from this. It assumes to construct
        religious objects out of the resources of logical reason alone, or of
        logical reason drawing rigorous inference from non-subjective facts.
        It calls its conclusions dogmatic theology, or philosophy of the
        absolute, as the case may be; it does not call them science of
        religions. It reaches them in an a priori way, and warrants their
        veracity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Warranted systems
        have ever been the idols of aspiring souls. All-inclusive, yet
        simple; noble, clean, luminous, stable, rigorous, true;—what more
        ideal refuge could <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page434">[pg
        434]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg434"/>
        there be than such a system would offer to spirits vexed by the
        muddiness and accidentality of the world of sensible things?
        Accordingly, we find inculcated in the theological schools of to-day,
        almost as much as in those of the fore-time, a disdain for merely
        possible or probable truth, and of results that only private
        assurance can grasp. Scholastics and idealists both express this
        disdain. Principal John Caird, for example, writes as follows in his
        Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion:—</p>

        his will gathered from the immediate issues of human affairs, if his
        Essence is just as high and deep and broad as the universe and no
        more; if this be the fact, then will I confess that there is no
        specific science about God, that theology is but a name, and a
        protest in its behalf an hypocrisy. Then, pious as it is to think of
        Him, while the pageant of experiment or abstract reasoning passes by,
        still such piety is nothing more than a poetry of thought, or an
        ornament of language, a certain view taken of Nature which one man
        has and another has not, which gifted minds strike out, which others
        see to be admirable and ingenious, and which all would be the better
        for adopting. It is but the theology of Nature, just as we talk of

          of the day, or the consent of the world, recognizes in any set of
          objects which are subjected to its contemplation. I do not see much
          difference between avowing that there is no God, and implying that

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In both these
        extracts we have the issue clearly set before us: Feeling valid only
        for the individual is pitted against reason valid universally. The
        test is a perfectly plain one of fact. Theology based on pure reason
        must in point of fact convince men universally. If it did not,
        wherein would its superiority consist? If it only formed sects and
        schools, even as sentiment and mysticism form them, how would it
        fulfill its programme of freeing us <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page436">[pg 436]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg436"/> from personal caprice and waywardness? This
        perfectly definite practical test of the pretensions of philosophy to
        found religion on universal reason simplifies my procedure to-day. I
        need not discredit philosophy by laborious criticism of its
        arguments. It will suffice if I show that as a matter of history it
        fails to prove its pretension to be <span class="tei tei-q">“objectively”</span> convincing. In fact, philosophy does
        so fail. It does not banish differences; it founds schools and sects
        just as feeling does. I believe, in fact, that the logical reason of
        man operates in this field of divinity exactly as it has always
        operated in love, or in patriotism, or in politics, or in any other
        of the wider affairs of life, in which our passions or our mystical
        intuitions fix our beliefs beforehand. It finds arguments for our
        conviction, for indeed it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">has</span></em> to find them. It amplifies and
        defines our faith, and dignifies it and lends it words and
        plausibility. It hardly ever engenders it; it cannot now secure
        it.<a href="#note_290" id="noteref_290" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">290</span></span></a></p>

<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lend me your
        attention while I run through some of the points of the older
        systematic theology. You find them in both Protestant and Catholic
        manuals, best of all in the innumerable text-books published since
        Pope Leo's Encyclical recommending the study of Saint Thomas. I
        glance first at the arguments by which dogmatic theology <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page437">[pg 437]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg437"/> establishes God's existence, after that
        at those by which it establishes his nature.<a href="#note_291" id="noteref_291" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">291</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The arguments for
        God's existence have stood for hundreds of years with the waves of
        unbelieving criticism breaking against them, never totally
        discrediting them in the ears of the faithful, but on the whole
        slowly and surely washing out the mortar from between their joints.
        If you have a God already whom you believe in, these arguments
        confirm you. If you are atheistic, they fail to set you right. The
        proofs are various. The <span class="tei tei-q">“cosmological”</span>
        one, so-called, reasons from the contingence of the world to a First
        Cause which must contain whatever perfections the world itself
        contains. The <span class="tei tei-q">“argument from design”</span>
        reasons, from the fact that Nature's laws are mathematical, and her
        parts benevolently adapted to each other, that this cause is both
        intellectual and benevolent. The <span class="tei tei-q">“moral
        argument”</span> is that the moral law presupposes a lawgiver. The
        <span class="tei tei-q">“argument <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex
        consensu gentium</span></span>”</span> is that the belief in God is
        so widespread as to be grounded in the rational nature of man, and
        should therefore carry authority with it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As I just said, I
        will not discuss these arguments technically. The bare fact that all
        idealists since Kant have felt entitled either to scout or to neglect
        them shows that they are not solid enough to serve as religion's
        all-sufficient foundation. Absolutely impersonal reasons would be in
        duty bound to show more general convincingness. Causation is indeed
        too obscure a principle to bear the weight of the whole structure of
        theology. As for the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page438">[pg
        438]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg438"/>
        argument from design, see how Darwinian ideas have revolutionized it.
        Conceived as we now conceive them, as so many fortunate escapes from
        almost limitless processes of destruction, the benevolent adaptations
        which we find in Nature suggest a deity very different from the one
        who figured in the earlier versions of the argument.<a href="#note_292" id="noteref_292" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">292</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page439">[pg 439]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg439"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fact is that
        these arguments do but follow the combined suggestions of the facts
        and of our feeling. They prove nothing rigorously. They only
        corroborate our pre-existent partialities.</p>

<span style="font-size: 90%">and</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">absolute</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">,
          cannot not be, and cannot in any way be determined by anything
          else. This makes Him absolutely unlimited from without, and
          unlimited also from within; for limitation is non-being; and God is
          being itself. This unlimitedness makes God infinitely perfect.
          Moreover, God is</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">One</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, and</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Only</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, for the infinitely perfect can admit no peer. He
          is</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Spiritual</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">,
          for were He composed of physical parts, some other power would have
          to combine them into the total, and his aseity would thus be
          contradicted. He is therefore both simple and non-physical in
          nature. He is</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">simple
          metaphysically</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">also, that
          is to say, his nature and his existence cannot</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page440">[pg 440]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg440"/><span style="font-size: 90%">be
          distinct, as they are in finite substances which share their formal
          natures with one another, and are individual only in their material
          aspect. Since God is one and only, his</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">essentia</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">and
          his</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">esse</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">must be given at one stroke. This
          excludes from his being all those distinctions, so familiar in the
          world of finite things, between potentiality and actuality,
          substance and accidents, being and activity, existence and
          attributes. We can talk, it is true, of God's powers, acts, and
          attributes, but these discriminations are only</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">virtual,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">and
          made from the human point of view. In God all these points of view
          fall into an absolute identity of being.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">This absence of all potentiality in God obliges
          Him to be</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">immutable</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">.
          He is actuality, through and through. Were there anything potential
          about Him, He would either lose or gain by its actualization, and
          either loss or gain would contradict his perfection. He cannot,
          therefore, change. Furthermore, He is</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">immense</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">,</span>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">boundless</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">;
          for could He be outlined in space, He would be composite, and this
          would contradict his indivisibility. He is therefore</span>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">omnipresent</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">,
          indivisibly there, at every point of space. He is similarly wholly
          present at every point of time,—in other words</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">eternal</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">.
          For if He began in time, He would need a prior cause, and that
          would contradict his aseity. If He ended, it would contradict his
          necessity. If He went through any succession, it would contradict
          his immutability.</span></p>

          for He is present to all time. Even our free acts are known
          beforehand to Him, for otherwise his wisdom would admit of
          successive moments of enrichment, and this would contradict his

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">creation</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">.
          If what He creates were made of his own substance, it would have to
          be infinite in essence, as that substance is; but it is finite; so
          it must be non-divine in substance. If it were made of a substance,
          an eternally existing matter, for example, which God found there to
          his hand, and to which He simply gave its form, that would
          contradict God's definition as First Cause, and make Him a mere
          mover of something caused already. The things he creates, then, He
          creates</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">ex
          nihilo</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, and gives them
          absolute being as so many finite substances additional to himself.
          The forms which he imprints upon them have their prototypes in his
          ideas. But as in God there is no such thing as multiplicity, and as
          these ideas for us are manifold, we must distinguish the ideas as
          they are in God and the way in which our minds externally imitate
          them. We must attribute them to Him only in a</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">terminative</span></em>
<span style="font-size: 90%">sense, as differing aspects, from the
          finite point of view, of his unique essence.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">God of course is holy, good, and just. He can do
          no evil, for He is positive being's fullness, and evil is negation.
          It is true that He has created physical evil in places, but only as
          a means of wider good, for</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">bonum totius præeminet bonum

<span style="font-size: 90%">it only, neither his justice nor his

          others must be rational beings, capable in the first place of
          knowledge, love, and honor, and in the second place of happiness,
          for the knowledge and love of God is the mainspring of felicity. In
          so far forth one may say that God's secondary purpose in creating

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I will not weary
        you by pursuing these metaphysical determinations farther, into the
        mysteries of God's Trinity, for example. What I have given will serve
        as a specimen of the orthodox philosophical theology of both
        Catholics and Protestants. Newman, filled with enthusiasm at God's
        list of perfections, continues the passage which I began to quote to
        you by a couple of pages of a rhetoric so magnificent that I can
        hardly refrain from adding them, in spite of the inroad they would
        make upon our time.<a href="#note_294" id="noteref_294" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">294</span></span></a> He
        first enumerates God's attributes sonorously, then celebrates his
        ownership of everything in earth and Heaven, and the dependence of
        all that happens upon his permissive will. He gives us scholastic
        philosophy <span class="tei tei-q">“touched with emotion,”</span> and
        every philosophy should be touched with emotion to be rightly
        understood. Emotionally, then, dogmatic theology is worth something
        to minds of the type of Newman's. It will aid us to estimate what it
        is worth intellectually, if at this point I make a short
        digression.</p>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What God hath
        joined together, let no man put asunder. The Continental schools of
        philosophy have too often overlooked the fact that man's thinking is
        organically connected with his conduct. It seems to me to be
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page443">[pg 443]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg443"/> the chief glory of English and
        Scottish thinkers to have kept the organic connection in view. The
        guiding principle of British philosophy has in fact been that every
        difference must <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">make</span></em> a difference, every theoretical
        difference somewhere issue in a practical difference, and that the
        best method of discussing points of theory is to begin by
        ascertaining what practical difference would result from one
        alternative or the other being true. What is the particular truth in
        question <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">known as</span></em>? In what facts does it
        result? What is its cash-value in terms of particular experience?
        This is the characteristic English way of taking up a question. In
        this way, you remember, Locke takes up the question of personal
        identity. What you mean by it is just your chain of particular
        memories, says he. That is the only concretely verifiable part of its
        significance. All further ideas about it, such as the oneness or
        manyness of the spiritual substance on which it is based, are
        therefore void of intelligible meaning; and propositions touching
        such ideas may be indifferently affirmed or denied. So Berkeley with
        his <span class="tei tei-q">“matter.”</span> The cash-value of matter
        is our physical sensations. That is what it is known as, all that we
        concretely verify of its conception. That, therefore, is the whole
        meaning of the term <span class="tei tei-q">“matter”</span>—any other
        pretended meaning is mere wind of words. Hume does the same thing
        with causation. It is known as habitual antecedence, and as tendency
        on our part to look for something definite to come. Apart from this
        practical meaning it has no significance whatever, and books about it
        may be committed to the flames, says Hume. Dugald Stewart and Thomas
        Brown, James Mill, John Mill, and Professor Bain, have followed more
        or less consistently the same method; and Shadworth Hodgson has used
        the principle with full explicitness. When all is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page444">[pg 444]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg444"/> said and done, it was English and Scotch
        writers, and not Kant, who introduced <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        critical method”</span> into philosophy, the one method fitted to
        make philosophy a study worthy of serious men. For what seriousness
        can possibly remain in debating philosophic propositions that will
        never make an appreciable difference to us in action? And what could
        it matter, if all propositions were practically indifferent, which of
        them we should agree to call true or which false?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An American
        philosopher of eminent originality, Mr. Charles Sanders Peirce, has
        rendered thought a service by disentangling from the particulars of
        its application the principle by which these men were instinctively
        guided, and by singling it out as fundamental and giving to it a
        Greek name. He calls it the principle of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pragmatism</span></em>, and he defends it
        somewhat as follows:<a href="#note_295" id="noteref_295" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">295</span></span></a>—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thought in
        movement has for its only conceivable motive the attainment of
        belief, or thought at rest. Only when our thought about a subject has
        found its rest in belief can our action on the subject firmly and
        safely begin. Beliefs, in short, are rules for action; and the whole
        function of thinking is but one step in the production of active
        habits. If there were any part of a thought that made no difference
        in the thought's practical consequences, then that part would be no
        proper element of the thought's significance. To develop a thought's
        meaning we need therefore only determine what conduct it is fitted to
        produce; that conduct is for us its sole significance; and the
        tangible fact at the root of all our thought-distinctions is that
        there is no one of them so fine as to consist in anything but a
        possible difference of practice. To attain perfect clearness in our
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page445">[pg 445]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg445"/> thoughts of an object, we need
        then only consider what sensations, immediate or remote, we are
        conceivably to expect from it, and what conduct we must prepare in
        case the object should be true. Our conception of these practical
        consequences is for us the whole of our conception of the object, so
        far as that conception has positive significance at all.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is the
        principle of Peirce, the principle of pragmatism. Such a principle
        will help us on this occasion to decide, among the various attributes
        set down in the scholastic inventory of God's perfections, whether
        some be not far less significant than others.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, namely, we
        apply the principle of pragmatism to God's metaphysical attributes,
        strictly so called, as distinguished from his moral attributes, I
        think that, even were we forced by a coercive logic to believe them,
        we still should have to confess them to be destitute of all
        intelligible significance. Take God's aseity, for example; or his
        necessariness; his immateriality; his <span class="tei tei-q">“simplicity”</span> or superiority to the kind of inner
        variety and succession which we find in finite beings, his
        indivisibility, and lack of the inner distinctions of being and
        activity, substance and accident, potentiality and actuality, and the
        rest; his repudiation of inclusion in a genus; his actualized
        infinity; his <span class="tei tei-q">“personality,”</span> apart
        from the moral qualities which it may comport; his relations to evil
        being permissive and not positive; his self-sufficiency, self-love,
        and absolute felicity in himself:—candidly speaking, how do such
        qualities as these make any definite connection with our life? And if
        they severally call for no distinctive adaptations of our conduct,
        what vital difference can it possibly make to a man's religion
        whether they be true or false?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For my own part,
        although I dislike to say aught that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page446">[pg 446]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg446"/> may grate upon tender associations, I must
        frankly confess that even though these attributes were faultlessly
        deduced, I cannot conceive of its being of the smallest consequence
        to us religiously that any one of them should be true. Pray, what
        specific act can I perform in order to adapt myself the better to
        God's simplicity? Or how does it assist me to plan my behavior, to
        know that his happiness is anyhow absolutely complete? In the middle
        of the century just past, Mayne Reid was the great writer of books of
        out-of-door adventure. He was forever extolling the hunters and
        field-observers of living animals' habits, and keeping up a fire of
        invective against the <span class="tei tei-q">“closet-naturalists,”</span> as he called them, the
        collectors and classifiers, and handlers of skeletons and skins. When
        I was a boy, I used to think that a closet-naturalist must be the
        vilest type of wretch under the sun. But surely the systematic
        theologians are the closet-naturalists of the deity, even in Captain
        Mayne Reid's sense. What is their deduction of metaphysical
        attributes but a shuffling and matching of pedantic
        dictionary-adjectives, aloof from morals, aloof from human needs,
        something that might be worked out from the mere word <span class="tei tei-q">“God”</span> by one of those logical machines of wood and
        brass which recent ingenuity has contrived as well as by a man of
        flesh and blood. They have the trail of the serpent over them. One
        feels that in the theologians' hands, they are only a set of titles
        obtained by a mechanical manipulation of synonyms; verbality has
        stepped into the place of vision, professionalism into that of life.
        Instead of bread we have a stone; instead of a fish, a serpent. Did
        such a conglomeration of abstract terms give really the gist of our
        knowledge of the deity, schools of theology might indeed continue to
        flourish, but religion, vital religion, would have taken its flight
        from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page447">[pg 447]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg447"/> this world. What keeps
        religion going is something else than abstract definitions and
        systems of concatenated adjectives, and something different from
        faculties of theology and their professors. All these things are
        after-effects, secondary accretions upon those phenomena of vital
        conversation with the unseen divine, of which I have shown you so
        many instances, renewing themselves <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in
        sæcula sæculorum</span></span> in the lives of humble private
        men.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So much for the
        metaphysical attributes of God! From the point of view of practical
        religion, the metaphysical monster which they offer to our worship is
        an absolutely worthless invention of the scholarly mind.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What shall we now
        say of the attributes called moral? Pragmatically, they stand on an
        entirely different footing. They positively determine fear and hope
        and expectation, and are foundations for the saintly life. It needs
        but a glance at them to show how great is their significance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">God's holiness,
        for example: being holy, God can will nothing but the good. Being
        omnipotent, he can secure its triumph. Being omniscient, he can see
        us in the dark. Being just, he can punish us for what he sees. Being
        loving, he can pardon too. Being unalterable, we can count on him
        securely. These qualities enter into connection with our life, it is
        highly important that we should be informed concerning them. That
        God's purpose in creation should be the manifestation of his glory is
        also an attribute which has definite relations to our practical life.
        Among other things it has given a definite character to worship in
        all Christian countries. If dogmatic theology really does prove
        beyond dispute that a God with characters like these exists, she may
        well claim to give a solid basis to religious sentiment. But verily,
        how stands it with her arguments?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page448">[pg 448]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg448"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It stands with
        them as ill as with the arguments for his existence. Not only do
        post-Kantian idealists reject them root and branch, but it is a plain
        historic fact that they never have converted any one who has found in
        the moral complexion of the world, as he experienced it, reasons for
        doubting that a good God can have framed it. To prove God's goodness
        by the scholastic argument that there is no non-being in his essence
        would sound to such a witness simply silly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No! the book of
        Job went over this whole matter once for all and definitively.
        Ratiocination is a relatively superficial and unreal path to the
        deity: <span class="tei tei-q">“I will lay mine hand upon my mouth; I
        have heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth
        Thee.”</span> An intellect perplexed and baffled, yet a trustful
        sense of presence—such is the situation of the man who is sincere
        with himself and with the facts, but who remains religious
        still.<a href="#note_296" id="noteref_296" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">296</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We must therefore,
        I think, bid a definitive good-by to dogmatic theology. In all
        sincerity our faith must do without that warrant. Modern idealism, I
        repeat, has said good-by to this theology forever. Can modern
        idealism give faith a better warrant, or must she still rely on her
        poor self for witness?</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The basis of
        modern idealism is Kant's doctrine of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page449">[pg 449]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg449"/> Transcendental Ego of Apperception. By this
        formidable term Kant merely meant the fact that the consciousness
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I think them”</span> must (potentially or
        actually) accompany all our objects. Former skeptics had said as
        much, but the <span class="tei tei-q">“I”</span> in question had
        remained for them identified with the personal individual. Kant
        abstracted and depersonalized it, and made it the most universal of
        all his categories, although for Kant himself the Transcendental Ego
        had no theological implications.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was reserved
        for his successors to convert Kant's notion of <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Bewusstsein überhaupt</span></span>, or abstract
        consciousness, into an infinite concrete self-consciousness which is
        the soul of the world, and in which our sundry personal
        self-consciousnesses have their being. It would lead me into
        technicalities to show you even briefly how this transformation was
        in point of fact effected. Suffice it to say that in the Hegelian
        school, which to-day so deeply influences both British and American
        thinking, two principles have borne the brunt of the operation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first of these
        principles is that the old logic of identity never gives us more than
        a post-mortem dissection of <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">disjecta
        membra</span></span>, and that the fullness of life can be construed
        to thought only by recognizing that every object which our thought
        may propose to itself involves the notion of some other object which
        seems at first to negate the first one.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
        principle is that to be conscious of a negation is already virtually
        to be beyond it. The mere asking of a question or expression of a
        dissatisfaction proves that the answer or the satisfaction is already
        imminent; the finite, realized as such, is already the infinite
        <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in posse</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Applying these
        principles, we seem to get a propulsive force into our logic which
        the ordinary logic of a bare, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page450">[pg 450]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg450"/> stark self-identity in each thing never attains
        to. The objects of our thought now <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">act</span></em>
        within our thought, act as objects act when given in experience. They
        change and develop. They introduce something other than themselves
        along with them; and this other, at first only ideal or potential,
        presently proves itself also to be actual. It supersedes the thing at
        first supposed, and both verifies and corrects it, in developing the
        fullness of its meaning.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The program is
        excellent; the universe <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> a place where things are followed
        by other things that both correct and fulfill them; and a logic which
        gave us something like this movement of fact would express truth far
        better than the traditional school-logic, which never gets of its own
        accord from anything to anything else, and registers only predictions
        and subsumptions, or static resemblances and differences. Nothing
        could be more unlike the methods of dogmatic theology than those of
        this new logic. Let me quote in illustration some passages from the
        Scottish transcendentalist whom I have already named.</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em">

<span style="font-size: 90%">He replies:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Two things may without difficulty be proved, viz.,
          that this reality is an absolute Spirit, and conversely that it is
          only in communion with this absolute Spirit or Intelligence that
          the finite Spirit can realize itself. It is absolute; for the
          faintest movement of human intelligence would be arrested, if it
          did not presuppose the absolute reality of intelligence, of thought
          itself. Doubt or denial themselves presuppose and indirectly affirm
          it. When I pronounce anything to be true, I pronounce it, indeed,
          to be relative to thought, but not to be relative to my thought, or
          to the thought of any other individual mind. From the existence of
          all individual minds as such I can abstract; I can think them away.
          But that which I cannot think away is thought or self-consciousness
          itself, in its independence</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page451">[pg 451]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg451"/><span style="font-size: 90%">and absoluteness,
          or, in other words, an Absolute Thought or
          Self-Consciousness.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here, you see,
        Principal Caird makes the transition which Kant did not make: he
        converts the omnipresence of consciousness in general as a condition
        of <span class="tei tei-q">“truth”</span> being anywhere possible,
        into an omnipresent universal consciousness, which he identifies with
        God in his concreteness. He next proceeds to use the principle that
        to acknowledge your limits is in essence to be beyond them; and makes
        the transition to the religious experience of individuals in the
        following words:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">If [Man] were only a creature of transient
        sensations and impulses, of an ever coming and going succession of
        intuitions, fancies, feelings, then nothing could ever have for him
        the character of objective truth or reality. But it is the
        prerogative of man's spiritual nature that he can yield himself up to
        a thought and will that are infinitely larger than his own. As a
        thinking, self-conscious being, indeed, he may be said, by his very
        nature, to live in the atmosphere of the Universal Life. As a
        thinking being, it is possible for me to suppress and quell in my
        consciousness every movement of self-assertion, every notion and
        opinion that is merely mine, every desire that belongs to me as this
        particular Self, and to become the pure medium of a thought that is
        universal—in one word, to live no more my own life, but let my
        consciousness be possessed and suffused by the Infinite and Eternal
        life of spirit. And yet it is just in this renunciation of self that
        I truly gain myself, or realize the highest possibilities of my own
        nature. For whilst in one sense we give up self to live the universal
        and absolute life of reason, yet that to which we thus surrender
        ourselves is in reality our truer self. The life of absolute reason
        is not a life that is foreign to us.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless,
        Principal Caird goes on to say, so far as we are able outwardly to
        realize this doctrine, the balm it offers remains incomplete.
        Whatever we may be <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in posse</span></span>, the
        very best of us <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu</span></span> falls
        very short of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page452">[pg
        452]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg452"/>
        being absolutely divine. Social morality, love, and self-sacrifice
        even, merge our Self only in some other finite self or selves. They
        do not quite identify it with the Infinite. Man's ideal destiny,
        infinite in abstract logic, might thus seem in practice forever
        unrealizable.</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em">

        the contradiction between the ideal and the actual? We answer, There
        is such a solution, but in order to reach it we are carried beyond
        the sphere of morality into that of religion. It may be said to be
        the essential characteristic of religion as contrasted with morality,
        that it changes aspiration into fruition, anticipation into
        realization; that instead of leaving man in the interminable pursuit
        of a vanishing ideal, it makes him the actual partaker of a divine or
        infinite life. Whether we view religion from the human side or the
        divine—as the surrender of the soul to God, or as the life of God in
        the soul—in either aspect it is of its very essence that the Infinite
        has ceased to be a far-off vision, and has become a present reality.
        The very first pulsation of the spiritual life, when we rightly
        apprehend its significance, is the indication that the division
        between the Spirit and its object has vanished, that the ideal has
        become real, that the finite has reached its goal and become suffused
        with the presence and life of the Infinite.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Oneness of mind and will with the divine mind and
          will is not the future hope and aim of religion, but its very
          beginning and birth in the soul. To enter on the religious life is
          to terminate the struggle. In that act which constitutes the
          beginning of the religious life—call it faith, or trust, or
          self-surrender, or by whatever name you will—there is involved the
          identification of the finite with a life which is eternally
          realized. It is true indeed that the religious life is progressive;
          but understood in the light of the foregoing idea, religious
          progress is not progress</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">towards</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">,
          but</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">within</span></em>
<span style="font-size: 90%">the sphere of the Infinite. It is not
          the vain attempt by endless finite additions or increments to
          become possessed of infinite wealth, but it is the endeavor, by the
          constant exercise of spiritual activity, to appropriate that
          infinite inheritance of which we are already in</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page453">[pg 453]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg453"/><span style="font-size: 90%">possession.
          The whole future of the religious life is given in its beginning,
          but it is given implicitly. The position of the man who has entered
          on the religious life is that evil, error, imperfection, do not
          really belong to him: they are excrescences which have no organic
          relation to his true nature: they are already virtually, as they
          will be actually, suppressed and annulled, and in the very process
          of being annulled they become the means of spiritual progress.
          Though he is not exempt from temptation and conflict, [yet] in that
          inner sphere in which his true life lies, the struggle is over, the
          victory already achieved. It is not a finite but an infinite life
          which the spirit lives. Every pulse-beat of its [existence] is the
          expression and realization of the life of God.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_297" id="noteref_297" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">297</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">You will readily
        admit that no description of the phenomena of the religious
        consciousness could be better than these words of your lamented
        preacher and philosopher. They reproduce the very rapture of those
        crises of conversion of which we have been hearing; they utter what
        the mystic felt but was unable to communicate; and the saint, in
        hearing them, recognizes his own experience. It is indeed gratifying
        to find the content of religion reported so unanimously. But when all
        is said and done, has Principal Caird—and I only use him as an
        example of that whole mode of thinking—transcended the sphere of
        feeling and of the direct experience of the individual, and laid the
        foundations of religion in impartial reason? Has he made religion
        universal by coercive reasoning, transformed it from a private faith
        into a public certainty? Has he rescued its affirmations from
        obscurity and mystery?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I believe that he
        has done nothing of the kind, but that he has simply reaffirmed the
        individual's experiences in a more generalized vocabulary. And again,
        I can be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page454">[pg
        454]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg454"/>
        excused from proving technically that the transcendentalist
        reasonings fail to make religion universal, for I can point to the
        plain fact that a majority of scholars, even religiously disposed
        ones, stubbornly refuse to treat them as convincing. The whole of
        Germany, one may say, has positively rejected the Hegelian
        argumentation. As for Scotland, I need only mention Professor
        Fraser's and Professor Pringle-Pattison's memorable criticisms, with
        which so many of you are familiar.<a href="#note_298" id="noteref_298" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">298</span></span></a> Once
        more, I ask, if transcendental idealism were as objectively and
        absolutely rational as it pretends to be, could it possibly fail so
        egregiously to be persuasive?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What religion
        reports, you must remember, always purports to be a fact of
        experience: the divine is actually present, religion says, and
        between it and ourselves relations of give and take are actual. If
        definite perceptions of fact like this cannot stand upon their own
        feet, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page455">[pg 455]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg455"/> surely abstract
        reasoning cannot give them the support they are in need of.
        Conceptual processes can class facts, define them, interpret them;
        but they do not produce them, nor can they reproduce their
        individuality. There is always a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plus</span></em>, a
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thisness</span></em>, which feeling alone can
        answer for. Philosophy in this sphere is thus a secondary function,
        unable to warrant faith's veracity, and so I revert to the thesis
        which I announced at the beginning of this lecture.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all sad
        sincerity I think we must conclude that the attempt to demonstrate by
        purely intellectual processes the truth of the deliverances of direct
        religious experience is absolutely hopeless.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would be unfair
        to philosophy, however, to leave her under this negative sentence.
        Let me close, then, by briefly enumerating what she <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></em> do
        for religion. If she will abandon metaphysics and deduction for
        criticism and induction, and frankly transform herself from theology
        into science of religions, she can make herself enormously
        useful.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The spontaneous
        intellect of man always defines the divine which it feels in ways
        that harmonize with its temporary intellectual prepossessions.
        Philosophy can by comparison eliminate the local and the accidental
        from these definitions. Both from dogma and from worship she can
        remove historic incrustations. By confronting the spontaneous
        religious constructions with the results of natural science,
        philosophy can also eliminate doctrines that are now known to be
        scientifically absurd or incongruous.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sifting out in
        this way unworthy formulations, she can leave a residuum of
        conceptions that at least are possible. With these she can deal as
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hypotheses</span></em>, testing them in
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page456">[pg 456]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg456"/> all the manners, whether
        negative or positive, by which hypotheses are ever tested. She can
        reduce their number, as some are found more open to objection. She
        can perhaps become the champion of one which she picks out as being
        the most closely verified or verifiable. She can refine upon the
        definition of this hypothesis, distinguishing between what is
        innocent over-belief and symbolism in the expression of it, and what
        is to be literally taken. As a result, she can offer mediation
        between different believers, and help to bring about consensus of
        opinion. She can do this the more successfully, the better she
        discriminates the common and essential from the individual and local
        elements of the religious beliefs which she compares.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I do not see why a
        critical Science of Religions of this sort might not eventually
        command as general a public adhesion as is commanded by a physical
        science. Even the personally non-religious might accept its
        conclusions on trust, much as blind persons now accept the facts of
        optics—it might appear as foolish to refuse them. Yet as the science
        of optics has to be fed in the first instance, and continually
        verified later, by facts experienced by seeing persons; so the
        science of religions would depend for its original material on facts
        of personal experience, and would have to square itself with personal
        experience through all its critical reconstructions. It could never
        get away from concrete life, or work in a conceptual vacuum. It would
        forever have to confess, as every science confesses, that the
        subtlety of nature flies beyond it, and that its formulas are but
        approximations. Philosophy lives in words, but truth and fact well up
        into our lives in ways that exceed verbal formulation. There is in
        the living act of perception always something that glimmers and
        twinkles and will not be caught, and for which reflection
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page457">[pg 457]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg457"/> comes too late. No one knows
        this as well as the philosopher. He must fire his volley of new
        vocables out of his conceptual shotgun, for his profession condemns
        him to this industry, but he secretly knows the hollowness and
        irrelevancy. His formulas are like stereoscopic or kinetoscopic
        photographs seen outside the instrument; they lack the depth, the
        motion, the vitality. In the religious sphere, in particular, belief
        that formulas are true can never wholly take the place of personal
        experience.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In my next lecture
        I will try to complete my rough description of religious experience;
        and in the lecture after that, which is the last one, I will try my
        own hand at formulating conceptually the truth to which it is a
        witness.</p>

<span style="font-size: 173%">Lecture XIX. Other
        Characteristics.</span></h1>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have wound our
        way back, after our excursion through mysticism and philosophy, to
        where we were before: the uses of religion, its uses to the
        individual who has it, and the uses of the individual himself to the
        world, are the best arguments that truth is in it. We return to the
        empirical philosophy: the true is what works well, even though the
        qualification <span class="tei tei-q">“on the whole”</span> may
        always have to be added. In this lecture we must revert to
        description again, and finish our picture of the religious
        consciousness by a word about some of its other characteristic
        elements. Then, in a final lecture, we shall be free to make a
        general review and draw our independent conclusions.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first point I
        will speak of is the part which the æsthetic life plays in
        determining one's choice of a religion. Men, I said awhile ago,
        involuntarily intellectualize their religious experience. They need
        formulas, just as they need fellowship in worship. I spoke,
        therefore, too contemptuously of the pragmatic uselessness of the
        famous scholastic list of attributes of the deity, for they have one
        use which I neglected to consider. The eloquent passage in which
        Newman enumerates them<a href="#note_299" id="noteref_299" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">299</span></span></a> puts us
        on the track of it. Intoning them as he would intone a cathedral
        service, he shows how high is their æsthetic value. It enriches our
        bare piety to carry these exalted and mysterious verbal additions
        just as it enriches <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page459">[pg
        459]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg459"/> a
        church to have an organ and old brasses, marbles and frescoes and
        stained windows. Epithets lend an atmosphere and overtones to our
        devotion. They are like a hymn of praise and service of glory, and
        may sound the more sublime for being incomprehensible. Minds like
        Newman's<a href="#note_300" id="noteref_300" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">300</span></span></a> grow as
        jealous of their credit as heathen priests are of that of the jewelry
        and ornaments that blaze upon their idols.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
        buildings-out of religion which the mind spontaneously indulges in,
        the æsthetic motive must never be forgotten. I promised to say
        nothing of ecclesiastical systems in these lectures. I may be
        allowed, however, to put in a word at this point on the way in which
        their satisfaction of certain æsthetic needs contributes to their
        hold on human nature. Although some persons aim most at intellectual
        purity and simplification, for others <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">richness</span></em>
        is the supreme imaginative requirement.<a href="#note_301" id="noteref_301" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">301</span></span></a> When
        one's mind is strongly of this type, an individual religion will
        hardly serve the purpose. The inner need is rather <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page460">[pg 460]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg460"/> of something institutional and complex,
        majestic in the hierarchic interrelatedness of its parts, with
        authority descending from stage to stage, and at every stage objects
        for adjectives of mystery and splendor, derived in the last resort
        from the Godhead who is the fountain and culmination of the system.
        One feels then as if in presence of some vast incrusted work of
        jewelry or architecture; one hears the multitudinous liturgical
        appeal; one gets the honorific vibration coming from every quarter.
        Compared with such a noble complexity, in which ascending and
        descending movements seem in no way to jar upon stability, in which
        no single item, however humble, is insignificant, because so many
        august institutions hold it in its place, how flat does evangelical
        Protestantism appear, how bare the atmosphere of those isolated
        religious lives whose boast it is that <span class="tei tei-q">“man
        in the bush with God may meet.”</span><a href="#note_302" id="noteref_302" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">302</span></span></a> What a
        pulverization and leveling of what a gloriously piled-up structure!
        To an imagination used to the perspectives of dignity and glory, the
        naked gospel scheme seems to offer an almshouse for a palace.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is much like
        the patriotic sentiment of those brought up in ancient empires. How
        many emotions must be frustrated of their object, when one gives up
        the titles of dignity, the crimson lights and blare of brass, the
        gold embroidery, the plumed troops, the fear and trembling, and puts
        up with a president in a black coat who shakes hands with you, and
        comes, it may be, from a <span class="tei tei-q">“home”</span> upon a
        veldt or prairie with one sitting-room and a Bible on its
        centre-table. It pauperizes the monarchical imagination!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The strength of
        these æsthetic sentiments makes it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page461">[pg 461]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg461"/> rigorously impossible, it seems to me, that
        Protestantism, however superior in spiritual profundity it may be to
        Catholicism, should at the present day succeed in making many
        converts from the more venerable ecclesiasticism. The latter offers a
        so much richer pasturage and shade to the fancy, has so many cells
        with so many different kinds of honey, is so indulgent in its
        multiform appeals to human nature, that Protestantism will always
        show to Catholic eyes the almshouse physiognomy. The bitter
        negativity of it is to the Catholic mind incomprehensible. To
        intellectual Catholics many of the antiquated beliefs and practices
        to which the Church gives countenance are, if taken literally, as
        childish as they are to Protestants. But they are childish in the
        pleasing sense of <span class="tei tei-q">“childlike”</span>—innocent
        and amiable, and worthy to be smiled on in consideration of the
        undeveloped condition of the dear people's intellects. To the
        Protestant, on the contrary, they are childish in the sense of being
        idiotic falsehoods. He must stamp out their delicate and lovable
        redundancy, leaving the Catholic to shudder at his literalness. He
        appears to the latter as morose as if he were some hard-eyed, numb,
        monotonous kind of reptile. The two will never understand each
        other—their centres of emotional energy are too different. Rigorous
        truth and human nature's intricacies are always in need of a mutual
        interpreter.<a href="#note_303" id="noteref_303" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303</span></span></a> So much
        for the æsthetic diversities in the religious
        consciousness.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page462">[pg
        462]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg462"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In most books on
        religion, three things are represented as its most essential
        elements. These are Sacrifice, Confession, and Prayer. I must say a
        word in turn of each of these elements, though briefly. First of
        Sacrifice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sacrifices to gods
        are omnipresent in primeval worship; but, as cults have grown
        refined, burnt offerings and the blood of he-goats have been
        superseded by sacrifices more spiritual in their nature. Judaism,
        Islam, and Buddhism get along without ritual sacrifice; so does
        Christianity, save in so far as the notion is preserved in
        transfigured form in the mystery of Christ's atonement. These
        religions substitute offerings of the heart, renunciations of the
        inner self, for all those vain oblations. In the ascetic practices
        which Islam, Buddhism, and the older Christianity encourage we see
        how indestructible is the idea that sacrifice of some sort is a
        religious exercise. In lecturing on asceticism I spoke of its
        significance as symbolic of the sacrifices which life, whenever it is
        taken strenuously, calls for.<a href="#note_304" id="noteref_304" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304</span></span></a> But, as
        I said my say about those, and as these lectures expressly avoid
        earlier religious usages and questions of derivation, I will pass
        from the subject of Sacrifice altogether and turn to that of
        Confession.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to
        Confession I will also be most brief, saying my word about it
        psychologically, not historically. Not nearly as widespread as
        sacrifice, it corresponds to a more inward and moral stage of
        sentiment. It is part of the general system of purgation and
        cleansing which one feels one's self in need of, in order to be in
        right relations to one's deity. For him who confesses, shams are over
        and realities have begun; he has exteriorized his rottenness. If he
        has not actually got rid of it, he at least <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page463">[pg 463]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg463"/> no longer smears it over with a hypocritical
        show of virtue—he lives at least upon a basis of veracity. The
        complete decay of the practice of confession in Anglo-Saxon
        communities is a little hard to account for. Reaction against popery
        is of course the historic explanation, for in popery confession went
        with penances and absolution, and other inadmissible practices. But
        on the side of the sinner himself it seems as if the need ought to
        have been too great to accept so summary a refusal of its
        satisfaction. One would think that in more men the shell of secrecy
        would have had to open, the pent-in abscess to burst and gain relief,
        even though the ear that heard the confession were unworthy. The
        Catholic church, for obvious utilitarian reasons, has substituted
        auricular confession to one priest for the more radical act of public
        confession. We English-speaking Protestants, in the general
        self-reliance and unsociability of our nature, seem to find it enough
        if we take God alone into our confidence.<a href="#note_305" id="noteref_305" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">305</span></span></a></p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next topic on
        which I must comment is Prayer,—and this time it must be less
        briefly. We have heard much talk of late against prayer, especially
        against prayers for better weather and for the recovery of sick
        people. As regards prayers for the sick, if any medical fact can be
        considered to stand firm, it is that in certain environments prayer
        may contribute to recovery, and should be encouraged as a therapeutic
        measure. Being a normal factor of moral health in the person, its
        omission would be deleterious. The case of the weather is different.
        Notwithstanding the recency of the opposite belief,<a href="#note_306" id="noteref_306" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">306</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page464">[pg 464]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg464"/> every one now knows that
        droughts and storms follow from physical antecedents, and that moral
        appeals cannot avert them. But petitional prayer is only one
        department of prayer; and if we take the word in the wider sense as
        meaning every kind of inward communion or conversation with the power
        recognized as divine, we can easily see that scientific criticism
        leaves it untouched.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Prayer in this
        wide sense is the very soul and essence of religion. <span class="tei tei-q">“Religion,”</span> says a liberal French theologian,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“is an intercourse, a conscious and voluntary
        relation, entered into by a soul in distress with the mysterious
        power upon which it feels itself to depend, and upon which its fate
        is contingent. This intercourse with God is realized by prayer.
        Prayer is religion in act; that is, prayer is real religion. It is
        prayer that distinguishes the religious phenomenon from such similar
        or neighboring phenomena as purely moral or æsthetic sentiment.
        Religion is nothing if it be not the vital act by which the entire
        mind seeks to save itself by clinging to the principle from which it
        draws its life. This act is prayer, by which term I understand no
        vain exercise of words, no mere repetition of certain sacred formulæ,
        but the very movement itself of the soul, putting itself in a
        personal relation of contact with the mysterious power of which it
        feels the presence,—it may be even before it has a name by which to
        call it. Wherever this interior prayer is lacking, there is no
        religion; wherever, on the other hand, this prayer rises and stirs
        the soul, even in the absence of forms or of doctrines, we have
        living religion. One sees from this why <span class="tei tei-q">‘natural religion,’</span> so-called, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page465">[pg 465]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg465"/> is not properly a religion. It cuts man
        off from prayer. It leaves him and God in mutual remoteness, with no
        intimate commerce, no interior dialogue, no interchange, no action of
        God in man, no return of man to God. At bottom this pretended
        religion is only a philosophy. Born at epochs of rationalism, of
        critical investigations, it never was anything but an abstraction. An
        artificial and dead creation, it reveals to its examiner hardly one
        of the characters proper to religion.”</span><a href="#note_307" id="noteref_307" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">307</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seems to me
        that the entire series of our lectures proves the truth of M.
        Sabatier's contention. The religious phenomenon, studied as an inner
        fact, and apart from ecclesiastical or theological complications, has
        shown itself to consist everywhere, and at all its stages, in the
        consciousness which individuals have of an intercourse between
        themselves and higher powers with which they feel themselves to be
        related. This intercourse is realized at the time as being both
        active and mutual. If it be not effective; if it be not a give and
        take relation; if nothing be really transacted while it lasts; if the
        world is in no whit different for its having taken place; then
        prayer, taken in this wide meaning of a sense that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">something is
        transacting</span></em>, is of course a feeling of what is illusory,
        and religion must on the whole be classed, not simply as containing
        elements of delusion,—these undoubtedly everywhere exist,—but as
        being rooted in delusion altogether, just as materialists and
        atheists have always said it was. At most there might remain, when
        the direct experiences of prayer were ruled out as false witnesses,
        some inferential belief that the whole order of existence must have a
        divine cause. But this way of contemplating nature, pleasing as it
        would doubtless be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page466">[pg
        466]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg466"/> to
        persons of a pious taste, would leave to them but the spectators'
        part at a play, whereas in experimental religion and the prayerful
        life, we seem ourselves to be actors, and not in a play, but in a
        very serious reality.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The genuineness of
        religion is thus indissolubly bound up with the question whether the
        prayerful consciousness be or be not deceitful. The conviction that
        something is genuinely transacted in this consciousness is the very
        core of living religion. As to what is transacted, great differences
        of opinion have prevailed. The unseen powers have been supposed, and
        are yet supposed, to do things which no enlightened man can nowadays
        believe in. It may well prove that the sphere of influence in prayer
        is subjective exclusively, and that what is immediately changed is
        only the mind of the praying person. But however our opinion of
        prayer's effects may come to be limited by criticism, religion, in
        the vital sense in which these lectures study it, must stand or fall
        by the persuasion that effects of some sort genuinely do occur.
        Through prayer, religion insists, things which cannot be realized in
        any other manner come about: energy which but for prayer would be
        bound is by prayer set free and operates in some part, be it
        objective or subjective, of the world of facts.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This postulate is
        strikingly expressed in a letter written by the late Frederic W. H.
        Myers to a friend, who allows me to quote from it. It shows how
        independent the prayer-instinct is of usual doctrinal complications.
        Mr. Myers writes:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em">

        because I have rather strong ideas on the subject. First consider
        what are the facts. There exists around us a spiritual universe, and
        that universe is in actual relation with the material. From the
        spiritual universe comes the energy which maintains the
        material;</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page467">[pg

        of material nutriment changes from hour to hour.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I call these</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">facts</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">because I think that some scheme of this kind is
          the only one consistent with our actual evidence; too complex to

          in as much spiritual life as possible, and we must place our minds
          in any attitude which experience shows to be favorable to such
          indrawal.</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Prayer</span></em>

          purely subjective thing;—it means a real increase in intensity of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us reserve the
        question of the truth or falsehood of the belief that power is
        absorbed until the next lecture, when our dogmatic conclusions, if we
        have any, must be reached. Let this lecture still confine itself to
        the description of phenomena; and as a concrete example of an extreme
        sort, of the way in which the prayerful life may still be led, let me
        take a case with which most of you must be acquainted, that of George
        Müller of Bristol, who died in 1898. Müller's prayers were of the
        crassest petitional order. Early in life he resolved on taking
        certain Bible promises in literal sincerity, and on letting himself
        be fed, not by his own worldly foresight, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page468">[pg 468]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg468"/> but by the Lord's hand. He had an
        extraordinarily active and successful career, among the fruits of
        which were the distribution of over two million copies of the
        Scripture text, in different languages; the equipment of several
        hundred missionaries; the circulation of more than a hundred and
        eleven million of scriptural books, pamphlets, and tracts; the
        building of five large orphanages, and the keeping and educating of
        thousands of orphans; finally, the establishment of schools in which
        over a hundred and twenty-one thousand youthful and adult pupils were
        taught. In the course of this work Mr. Müller received and
        administered nearly a million and a half of pounds sterling, and
        traveled over two hundred thousand miles of sea and land.<a href="#note_308" id="noteref_308" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">308</span></span></a> During
        the sixty-eight years of his ministry, he never owned any property
        except his clothes and furniture, and cash in hand; and he left, at
        the age of eighty-six, an estate worth only a hundred and sixty
        pounds.</p>

          at last help comes, after many seasons of prayer it may be, how
          sweet it is, and what a present recompense! Dear Christian reader,

        a case extreme in every respect, and in no respect more so than in
        the extraordinary narrowness of the man's intellectual horizon. His
        God was, as he often said, his business partner. He seems to have
        been for Müller little more than a sort of supernatural clergyman
        interested in the congregation of tradesmen and others in Bristol who
        were his saints, and in the orphanages and other enterprises, but
        unpossessed of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page471">[pg

        of those vaster and wilder and more ideal attributes with which the
        human imagination elsewhere has invested him. Müller, in short, was
        absolutely unphilosophical. His intensely private and practical
        conception of his relations with the Deity continued the traditions
        of the most primitive human thought.<a href="#note_313" id="noteref_313" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">313</span></span></a> When we
        compare a mind like his with such a mind as, for example, Emerson's
        or Phillips Brooks's, we see the range which the religions
        consciousness covers.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is an
        immense literature relating to answers to petitional prayer. The
        evangelical journals are filled <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page472">[pg 472]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg472"/> with such answers, and books are devoted to the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A less sturdy

        proofs, palpable but much more subtle, of his presence and active
        influence. The following description of a <span class="tei tei-q">“led”</span> life, by a German writer whom I have already

        ignorant of what would have terrified one or led one astray, until
        the peril is past—this being especially the case with temptations to
        vanity and sensuality; that paths on which one ought not to wander
        are, as it were, hedged off with thorns; but that on the other side
        great obstacles are suddenly removed; that when the time has come for
        something, one suddenly receives a courage that formerly failed, or
        perceives the root of a matter that until then was concealed, or
        discovers thoughts, talents, yea, even pieces of knowledge and

          affairs neither too early nor too late, whereas they were wont to
          be spoiled by untimeliness, even when the preparations had been
          well laid. In addition to this, one does them with perfect
          tranquillity of mind, almost as if they were matters of no
          consequence, like errands done by us for another person, in which
          case we usually act more calmly than when we act in our own

          life's great arts. One finds also that each thing comes duly, one
          thing after the other, so that one gains time to make one's footing
          sure before advancing farther. And then everything occurs to us at
          the right moment, just what we ought to do, etc., and often in a
          very striking way, just as if a third person were keeping watch
          over those things which we are in easy danger of

          thoughts it would be hard for even the best of us always to keep

        events are tempered more towardly to us by a superintending
        providence, as a reward for our reliance, but that by cultivating the
        continuous sense of our connection with the power that made things as
        they are, we are tempered more towardly for their reception. The
        outward face of nature need not alter, but the expressions of meaning
        in it alter. It was dead and is alive again. It is like the
        difference between looking on a person without love, or upon the same
        person with love. In the latter case intercourse springs into new
        vitality. So when one's affections keep in touch with the divinity of
        the world's authorship, fear and egotism fall away; and in the
        equanimity that follows, one finds in the hours, as they succeed each
        other, a series of purely benignant opportunities. It is as if all
        doors were opened, and all paths freshly smoothed. We meet a new
        world when we meet the old world in the spirit which this kind of

        did a thousand years ago: and the morning hymn of Milton does but
        tell the beauty with which our own familiar sun dressed the earliest
        fields and gardens of the world. We see what all our fathers saw. And
        if we cannot find God in your house or in mine, upon the roadside or
        the margin of the sea; in the bursting seed or opening flower; in the
        day duty or the night musing; in the general laugh and the secret
        grief; in the procession of life, ever entering afresh, and solemnly
        passing by and dropping off; I do not think we should discern him any
        more on the grass of Eden, or beneath the moonlight of Gethsemane.
        Depend upon it, it is not the want of greater miracles, but of the
        soul to perceive such as are allowed us still, that makes us push all
        the sanctities into the far spaces we cannot reach. The devout feel
        that wherever God's hand is,</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">there</span></em> <span style="font-size: 90%">is miracle: and it is simply an indevoutness which
        imagines that only where miracle is, can there be the real hand of
        God. The customs of Heaven ought surely to be more sacred in our eyes
        than its anomalies; the dear old ways, of which the Most High is
        never tired, than the strange things which he does not love well
        enough ever to repeat. And he who will but discern beneath the sun,
        as he rises any morning, the supporting finger of the Almighty, may
        recover the sweet and reverent surprise with which Adam gazed on the
        first dawn in Paradise. It is no outward change, no shifting in time
        or place; but only the loving meditation of the pure in heart, that
        can reawaken the Eternal from the sleep within our souls: that can
        render him a reality again, and reassert for him once more his
        ancient name of</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">the Living

        with something which seemed to me ideally perfect. It was a poor
        drummer beating the tattoo in the streets of Paris. I walked behind
        him in returning to the school on the evening of a holiday. His drum
        gave out the tattoo in such a way that, at that moment at least,
        however peevish I were, I could find no pretext for fault-finding. It
        was impossible to conceive more nerve or spirit, better time or
        measure, more clearness or richness, than were in this drumming.
        Ideal desire could go no farther in that direction. I was enchanted
        and consoled; the perfection of this wretched act did me good. Good
        is at least possible, I said, since the ideal can thus sometimes get

        rule, religious persons generally assume that whatever natural facts
        connect themselves in any way with their destiny are significant of
        the divine purposes with them. Through prayer the purpose, often far
        from obvious, comes home to them, and if it be <span class="tei tei-q">“trial,”</span> strength to endure the trial is given.
        Thus at all stages of the prayerful life we find the persuasion that
        in the process of communion energy from on high flows in to meet
        demand, and becomes operative within the phenomenal world. So long as
        this operativeness is admitted to be real, it makes no essential
        difference whether its immediate effects be subjective or objective.
        The fundamental religious point is that in prayer, spiritual energy,
        which otherwise would slumber, does become active, and spiritual work
        of some kind is effected really.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So much for

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last aspect of
        the religious life which remains for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page478">[pg 478]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg478"/> me to touch upon is the fact that its
        manifestations so frequently connect themselves with the subconscious
        part of our existence. You may remember what I said in my opening
        lecture<a href="#note_321" id="noteref_321" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">321</span></span></a> about
        the prevalence of the psychopathic temperament in religious
        biography. You will in point of fact hardly find a religious leader
        of any kind in whose life there is no record of automatisms. I speak
        not merely of savage priests and prophets, whose followers regard
        automatic utterance and action as by itself tantamount to
        inspiration, I speak of leaders of thought and subjects of
        intellectualized experience. Saint Paul had his visions, his
        ecstasies, his gift of tongues, small as was the importance he
        attached to the latter. The whole array of Christian saints and
        heresiarchs, including the greatest, the Bernards, the Loyolas, the
        Luthers, the Foxes, the Wesleys, had their visions, voices, rapt
        conditions, guiding impressions, and <span class="tei tei-q">“openings.”</span> They had these things, because they
        had exalted sensibility, and to such things persons of exalted
        sensibility are liable. In such liability there lie, however,
        consequences for theology. Beliefs are strengthened wherever
        automatisms corroborate them. Incursions from beyond the
        transmarginal region have a peculiar power to increase conviction.
        The inchoate sense of presence is infinitely stronger than
        conception, but strong as it may be, it is seldom equal to the
        evidence of hallucination. Saints who actually see or hear their
        Saviour reach the acme of assurance. Motor automatisms, though rarer,
        are, if possible, even more convincing than sensations. The subjects
        here actually feel themselves played upon by powers beyond their
        will. The evidence is dynamic; the God or spirit moves the very
        organs of their body.<a href="#note_322" id="noteref_322" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">322</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page479">[pg 479]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg479"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great field
        for this sense of being the instrument of a higher power is of course
        <span class="tei tei-q">“inspiration.”</span> It is easy to
        discriminate between the religious leaders who have been habitually
        subject to inspiration and those who have not. In the teachings of
        the Buddha, of Jesus, of Saint Paul (apart from his gift of tongues),
        of Saint Augustine, of Huss, of Luther, of Wesley, automatic or
        semi-automatic composition appears to have been only occasional. In
        the Hebrew prophets, on the contrary, in Mohammed, in some of the
        Alexandrians, in many minor Catholic saints, in Fox, in Joseph Smith,
        something like it appears to have been frequent, sometimes habitual.
        We have distinct professions of being under the direction of a
        foreign power, and serving as its mouthpiece. As regards the Hebrew
        prophets, it is extraordinary, writes an author who has made a
        careful study of them, to see—</p>

        reproduced in the prophetic books. The process is always extremely
        different from what it would be if the prophet arrived at his insight
        into spiritual things by the tentative efforts of his own</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page480">[pg 480]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg480"/><span style="font-size: 90%">genius. There is something sharp and sudden about
          it. He can lay his finger, so to speak, on the moment when it came.
          And it always comes in the form of an overpowering force from
          without, against which he struggles, but in vain. Listen, for
          instance, [to] the opening of the book of Jeremiah. Read through in
          like manner the first two chapters of the prophecy of
          Ezekiel.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">It is not, however, only at the beginning of his
          career that the prophet passes through a crisis which is clearly
          not self-caused. Scattered all through the prophetic writings are
          expressions which speak of some strong and irresistible impulse
          coming down upon the prophet, determining his attitude to the
          events of his time, constraining his utterance, making his words
          the vehicle of a higher meaning than their own. For instance, this
          of Isaiah's:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">The Lord
          spake thus to me with a strong hand,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">—an
          emphatic phrase which denotes the overmastering nature of the
          impulse,—</span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">and
          instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this
          people.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">... Or passages like this from
          Ezekiel:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">The hand of
          the Lord God fell upon me,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">The hand of the Lord was strong upon
          me.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">The one standing characteristic of the prophet is
          that he speaks with the authority of Jehovah himself. Hence it is
          that the prophets one and all preface their addresses so
          confidently,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">The Word of
          the Lord,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">or</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Thus saith the Lord.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">They
          have even the audacity to speak in the first person, as if Jehovah
          himself were speaking. As in Isaiah:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel my called; I
          am He, I am the First, I also am the last,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">—and
          so on. The personality of the prophet sinks entirely into the
          background; he feels himself for the time being the mouthpiece of
          the Almighty.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_323" id="noteref_323" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">323</span></span></a></p>

          profession, and that the prophets formed a professional class.
          There were schools of the prophets, in which the gift was regularly
          cultivated. A group of young men would gather round some commanding
          figure—a Samuel or an Elisha—and would not only record or spread
          the knowledge of his sayings and doings, but seek to catch
          themselves something of his inspiration. It</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page481">[pg 481]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg481"/><span style="font-size: 90%">seems that
          music played its part in their exercises.... It is perfectly clear
          that by no means all of these Sons of the prophets ever succeeded
          in acquiring more than a very small share in the gift which they
          sought. It was clearly possible to</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">counterfeit</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">prophecy. Sometimes this was done deliberately....
          But it by no means follows that in all cases where a false message
          was given, the giver of it was altogether conscious of what he was
          doing.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_324" id="noteref_324" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">324</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we turn to
        Islam, we find that Mohammed's revelations all came from the

        heard a knell as from a bell, and that this had the strongest effect
        on him; and when the angel went away, he had received the revelation.
        Sometimes again he held converse with the angel as with a man, so as
        easily to understand his words. The later authorities, however, ...
        distinguish still other kinds. In the Itgân (103) the following are
        enumerated: 1, revelations with</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page482">[pg 482]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg482"/><span style="font-size: 90%">sound of bell, 2,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In none of these
        cases is the revelation distinctly motor. In the case of Joseph Smith
        (who had prophetic revelations innumerable in addition to the
        revealed translation of the gold plates which resulted in the Book of
        Mormon), although there may have been a motor element, the
        inspiration seems to have been predominantly sensorial. He began his
        translation by the aid of the <span class="tei tei-q">“peep-stones”</span> which he found, or thought or said
        that he found, with the gold plates,—apparently a case of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“crystal gazing.”</span> For some of the
        other revelations he used the peep-stones, but seems generally to
        have asked the Lord for more direct instruction.<a href="#note_327" id="noteref_327" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">327</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page483">[pg 483]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg483"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Other revelations
        are described as <span class="tei tei-q">“openings”</span>—Fox's, for
        example, were evidently of the kind known in spiritistic circles of
        to-day as <span class="tei tei-q">“impressions.”</span> As all
        effective initiators of change must needs live to some degree upon
        this psychopathic level of sudden perception or conviction of new
        truth, or of impulse to action so obsessive that it must be worked
        off, I will say nothing more about so very common a phenomenon.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When, in addition
        to these phenomena of inspiration, we take religious mysticism into
        the account, when we recall the striking and sudden unifications of a
        discordant self which we saw in conversion, and when we review the
        extravagant obsessions of tenderness, purity, and self-severity met
        with in saintliness, we cannot, I think, avoid the conclusion that in
        religion we have a department of human nature with unusually close
        relations to the trans-marginal or subliminal region. If the word
        <span class="tei tei-q">“subliminal”</span> is offensive to any of
        you, as smelling too much of psychical research or other aberrations,
        call it by any other name you please, to distinguish it from the
        level of full sunlit consciousness. Call this latter the A-region of
        personality, if you care to, and call the other the B-region. The
        B-region, then, is obviously the larger part of each of us, for it is
        the abode of everything that is latent and the reservoir of
        everything that passes unrecorded or unobserved. It contains, for
        example, such things as all our momentarily inactive memories, and it
        harbors the springs of all our obscurely motived passions, impulses,
        likes, dislikes, and prejudices. Our intuitions, hypotheses, fancies,
        superstitions, persuasions, convictions, and in general all our
        non-rational operations, come from it. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page484">[pg 484]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg484"/> It is the source of our dreams, and apparently
        they may return to it. In it arise whatever mystical experiences we
        may have, and our automatisms, sensory or motor; our life in hypnotic
        and <span class="tei tei-q">“hypnoid”</span> conditions, if we are
        subjects to such conditions; our delusions, fixed ideas, and
        hysterical accidents, if we are hysteric subjects; our supra-normal
        cognitions, if such there be, and if we are telepathic subjects. It
        is also the fountain-head of much that feeds our religion. In persons
        deep in the religious life, as we have now abundantly seen,—and this
        is my conclusion,—the door into this region seems unusually wide
        open; at any rate, experiences making their entrance through that
        door have had emphatic influence in shaping religious history.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this
        conclusion I turn back and close the circle which I opened in my
        first lecture, terminating thus the review which I then announced of
        inner religious phenomena as we find them in developed and articulate
        human individuals. I might easily, if the time allowed, multiply both
        my documents and my discriminations, but a broad treatment is, I
        believe, in itself better, and the most important characteristics of
        the subject lie, I think, before us already. In the next lecture,
        which is also the last one, we must try to draw the critical
        conclusions which so much material may suggest.</p>

<span style="font-size: 173%">Lecture XX. Conclusions.</span></h1>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The material of
        our study of human nature is now spread before us; and in this
        parting hour, set free from the duty of description, we can draw our
        theoretical and practical conclusions. In my first lecture, defending
        the empirical method, I foretold that whatever conclusions we might
        come to could be reached by spiritual judgments only, appreciations
        of the significance for life of religion, taken <span class="tei tei-q">“on the whole.”</span> Our conclusions cannot be as sharp
        as dogmatic conclusions would be, but I will formulate them, when the
        time comes, as sharply as I can.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Summing up in the
        broadest possible way the characteristics of the religious life, as
        we have found them, it includes the following beliefs:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. That the
        visible world is part of a more spiritual universe from which it
        draws its chief significance;</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. That union or
        harmonious relation with that higher universe is our true end;</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. That prayer or
        inner communion with the spirit thereof—be that spirit <span class="tei tei-q">“God”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“law”</span>—is a
        process wherein work is really done, and spiritual energy flows in
        and produces effects, psychological or material, within the
        phenomenal world.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Religion includes
        also the following psychological characteristics:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. A new zest
        which adds itself like a gift to life, and takes the form either of
        lyrical enchantment or of appeal to earnestness and
        heroism.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page486">[pg
        486]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg486"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">5. An assurance of
        safety and a temper of peace, and, in relation to others, a
        preponderance of loving affections.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In illustrating
        these characteristics by documents, we have been literally bathed in
        sentiment. In re-reading my manuscript, I am almost appalled at the
        amount of emotionality which I find in it. After so much of this, we
        can afford to be dryer and less sympathetic in the rest of the work
        that lies before us.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sentimentality
        of many of my documents is a consequence of the fact that I sought
        them among the extravagances of the subject. If any of you are
        enemies of what our ancestors used to brand as enthusiasm, and are,
        nevertheless, still listening to me now, you have probably felt my
        selection to have been sometimes almost perverse, and have wished I
        might have stuck to soberer examples. I reply that I took these
        extremer examples as yielding the profounder information. To learn
        the secrets of any science, we go to expert specialists, even though
        they may be eccentric persons, and not to commonplace pupils. We
        combine what they tell us with the rest of our wisdom, and form our
        final judgment independently. Even so with religion. We who have
        pursued such radical expressions of it may now be sure that we know
        its secrets as authentically as any one can know them who learns them
        from another; and we have next to answer, each of us for himself, the
        practical question: what are the dangers in this element of life? and
        in what proportion may it need to be restrained by other elements, to
        give the proper balance?</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this question
        suggests another one which I will answer immediately and get it out
        of the way, for it has more than once already vexed us.<a href="#note_328" id="noteref_328" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">328</span></span></a> Ought
        it to be assumed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page487">[pg
        487]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg487"/>
        that in all men the mixture of religion with other elements should be
        identical? Ought it, indeed, to be assumed that the lives of all men
        should show identical religious elements? In other words, is the
        existence of so many religious types and sects and creeds
        regrettable?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To these questions
        I answer <span class="tei tei-q">“No”</span> emphatically. And my
        reason is that I do not see how it is possible that creatures in such
        different positions and with such different powers as human
        individuals are, should have exactly the same functions and the same
        duties. No two of us have identical difficulties, nor should we be
        expected to work out identical solutions. Each, from his peculiar
        angle of observation, takes in a certain sphere of fact and trouble,
        which each must deal with in a unique manner. One of us must soften
        himself, another must harden himself; one must yield a point, another
        must stand firm,—in order the better to defend the position assigned
        him. If an Emerson were forced to be a Wesley, or a Moody forced to
        be a Whitman, the total human consciousness of the divine would
        suffer. The divine can mean no single quality, it must mean a group
        of qualities, by being champions of which in alternation, different
        men may all find worthy missions. Each attitude being a syllable in
        human nature's total message, it takes the whole of us to spell the
        meaning out completely. So a <span class="tei tei-q">“god of
        battles”</span> must be allowed to be the god for one kind of person,
        a god of peace and heaven and home, the god for another. We must
        frankly recognize the fact that we live in partial systems, and that
        parts are not interchangeable in the spiritual life. If we are
        peevish and jealous, destruction of the self must be an element of
        our religion; why need it be one if we are good and sympathetic from
        the outset? If we are sick souls, we require a religion of
        deliverance; but why think so much <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page488">[pg 488]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg488"/> of deliverance, if we are healthy-minded?<a href="#note_329" id="noteref_329" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">329</span></span></a>
        Unquestionably, some men have the completer experience and the higher
        vocation, here just as in the social world; but for each man to stay
        in his own experience, whate'er it be, and for others to tolerate him
        there, is surely best.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, you may now
        ask, would not this one-sidedness be cured if we should all espouse
        the science of religions as our own religion? In answering this
        question I must open again the general relations of the theoretic to
        the active life.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Knowledge about a
        thing is not the thing itself. You remember what Al-Ghazzali told us
        in the Lecture on Mysticism,—that to understand the causes of
        drunkenness, as a physician understands them, is not to be drunk. A
        science might come to understand everything about the causes and
        elements of religion, and might even <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page489">[pg 489]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg489"/> decide which elements were qualified, by their
        general harmony with other branches of knowledge, to be considered
        true; and yet the best man at this science might be the man who found
        it hardest to be personally devout. <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Tout
        savoir c'est tout pardonner.</span></span> The name of Renan would
        doubtless occur to many persons as an example of the way in which
        breadth of knowledge may make one only a dilettante in possibilities,
        and blunt the acuteness of one's living faith.<a href="#note_330" id="noteref_330" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">330</span></span></a> If
        religion be a function by which either God's cause or man's cause is
        to be really advanced, then he who lives the life of it, however
        narrowly, is a better servant than he who merely knows about it,
        however much. Knowledge about life is one thing; effective occupation
        of a place in life, with its dynamic currents passing through your
        being, is another.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For this reason,
        the science of religions may not be an equivalent for living
        religion; and if we turn to the inner difficulties of such a science,
        we see that a point comes when she must drop the purely theoretic
        attitude, and either let her knots remain uncut, or have them cut by
        active faith. To see this, suppose that we have our science of
        religions constituted as a matter of fact. Suppose that she has
        assimilated all the necessary historical material and distilled out
        of it as its essence the same conclusions which I myself a few
        moments ago pronounced. Suppose that she agrees that religion,
        wherever it is an active thing, involves a belief in ideal presences,
        and a belief that in our prayerful communion with them,<a href="#note_331" id="noteref_331" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">331</span></span></a> work is
        done, and something real comes to pass. She has now to exert her
        critical activity, and to decide how far, in the light of other
        sciences and in that of general philosophy, such beliefs can be
        considered <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true</span></em>.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page490">[pg 490]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg490"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dogmatically to
        decide this is an impossible task. Not only are the other sciences
        and the philosophy still far from being completed, but in their
        present state we find them full of conflicts. The sciences of nature
        know nothing of spiritual presences, and on the whole hold no
        practical commerce whatever with the idealistic conceptions towards
        which general philosophy inclines. The scientist, so-called, is,
        during his scientific hours at least, so materialistic that one may
        well say that on the whole the influence of science goes against the
        notion that religion should be recognized at all. And this antipathy
        to religion finds an echo within the very science of religions
        itself. The cultivator of this science has to become acquainted with
        so many groveling and horrible superstitions that a presumption
        easily arises in his mind that any belief that is religious probably
        is false. In the <span class="tei tei-q">“prayerful communion”</span>
        of savages with such mumbo-jumbos of deities as they acknowledge, it
        is hard for us to see what genuine spiritual work—even though it were
        work relative only to their dark savage obligations—can possibly be
        done.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The consequence is
        that the conclusions of the science of religions are as likely to be
        adverse as they are to be favorable to the claim that the essence of
        religion is true. There is a notion in the air about us that religion
        is probably only an anachronism, a case of <span class="tei tei-q">“survival,”</span> an atavistic relapse into a mode of
        thought which humanity in its more enlightened examples has outgrown;
        and this notion our religious anthropologists at present do little to
        counteract.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This view is so
        widespread at the present day that I must consider it with some
        explicitness before I pass to my own conclusions. Let me call it the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Survival theory,”</span> for brevity's
        sake.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page491">[pg
        491]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg491"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pivot round
        which the religious life, as we have traced it, revolves, is the
        interest of the individual in his private personal destiny. Religion,
        in short, is a monumental chapter in the history of human egotism.
        The gods believed in—whether by crude savages or by men disciplined
        intellectually—agree with each other in recognizing personal calls.
        Religious thought is carried on in terms of personality, this being,
        in the world of religion, the one fundamental fact. To-day, quite as
        much as at any previous age, the religious individual tells you that
        the divine meets him on the basis of his personal concerns.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Science, on the
        other hand, has ended by utterly repudiating the personal point of
        view. She catalogues her elements and records her laws indifferent as
        to what purpose may be shown forth by them, and constructs her
        theories quite careless of their bearing on human anxieties and
        fates. Though the scientist may individually nourish a religion, and
        be a theist in his irresponsible hours, the days are over when it
        could be said that for Science herself the heavens declare the glory
        of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork. Our solar system,
        with its harmonies, is seen now as but one passing case of a certain
        sort of moving equilibrium in the heavens, realized by a local
        accident in an appalling wilderness of worlds where no life can
        exist. In a span of time which as a cosmic interval will count but as
        an hour, it will have ceased to be. The Darwinian notion of chance
        production, and subsequent destruction, speedy or deferred, applies
        to the largest as well as to the smallest facts. It is impossible, in
        the present temper of the scientific imagination, to find in the
        driftings of the cosmic atoms, whether they work on the universal or
        on the particular scale, anything but a kind of aimless weather,
        doing and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page492">[pg
        492]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg492"/>
        undoing, achieving no proper history, and leaving no result. Nature
        has no one distinguishable ultimate tendency with which it is
        possible to feel a sympathy. In the vast rhythm of her processes, as
        the scientific mind now follows them, she appears to cancel herself.
        The books of natural theology which satisfied the intellects of our
        grandfathers seem to us quite grotesque,<a href="#note_332" id="noteref_332" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">332</span></span></a>
        representing, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page493">[pg
        493]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg493"/> as
        they did, a God who conformed the largest things of nature to the
        paltriest of our private wants. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page494">[pg 494]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg494"/> God whom science recognizes must be a God of
        universal laws exclusively, a God who does a wholesale, not a retail
        business. He cannot accommodate his processes to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page495">[pg 495]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg495"/> convenience of individuals. The bubbles
        on the foam which coats a stormy sea are floating episodes, made and
        unmade by the forces of the wind and water. Our private selves are
        like those bubbles,—epiphenomena, as Clifford, I believe, ingeniously
        called them; their destinies weigh nothing and determine nothing in
        the world's irremediable currents of events.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">You see how
        natural it is, from this point of view, to treat religion as a mere
        survival, for religion does in fact perpetuate the traditions of the
        most primeval thought. To coerce the spiritual powers, or to square
        them and get them on our side, was, during enormous tracts of time,
        the one great object in our dealings with the natural world. For our
        ancestors, dreams, hallucinations, revelations, and cock-and-bull
        stories were inextricably mixed with facts. Up to a comparatively
        recent date such distinctions as those between what has been verified
        and what is only conjectured, between the impersonal and the personal
        aspects of existence, were hardly suspected or conceived. Whatever
        you imagined in a lively manner, whatever you thought fit to be true,
        you affirmed confidently; and whatever you affirmed, your comrades
        believed. Truth was what had not yet been contradicted, most things
        were taken into the mind from the point of view of their human
        suggestiveness, and the attention confined itself exclusively to the
        æsthetic and dramatic aspects of events.<a href="#note_333" id="noteref_333" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">333</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page496">[pg 496]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg496"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How indeed could
        it be otherwise? The extraordinary value, for explanation and
        prevision, of those mathematical <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page497">[pg 497]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg497"/> and mechanical modes of conception which
        science uses, was a result that could not possibly have been expected
        in advance. Weight, movement, velocity, direction, position, what
        thin, pallid, uninteresting ideas! How could the richer animistic
        aspects of Nature, the peculiarities and oddities that make phenomena
        picturesquely striking or expressive, fail to have been first singled
        out and followed by philosophy as the more promising avenue to the
        knowledge of Nature's life? Well, it is still in these richer
        animistic and dramatic aspects that religion delights <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page498">[pg 498]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg498"/> to dwell. It is the terror and beauty of
        phenomena, the <span class="tei tei-q">“promise”</span> of the dawn
        and of the rainbow, the <span class="tei tei-q">“voice”</span> of the
        thunder, the <span class="tei tei-q">“gentleness”</span> of the
        summer rain, the <span class="tei tei-q">“sublimity”</span> of the
        stars, and not the physical laws which these things follow, by which
        the religious mind still continues to be most impressed; and just as
        of yore, the devout man tells you that in the solitude of his room or
        of the fields he still feels the divine presence, that inflowings of
        help come in reply to his prayers, and that sacrifices to this unseen
        reality fill him with security and peace.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pure anachronism!
        says the survival-theory;—anachronism for which
        deanthropomorphization of the imagination is the remedy required. The
        less we mix the private with the cosmic, the more we dwell in
        universal and impersonal terms, the truer heirs of Science we
        become.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In spite of the
        appeal which this impersonality of the scientific attitude makes to a
        certain magnanimity of temper, I believe it to be shallow, and I can
        now state my reason in comparatively few words. That reason is that,
        so long as we deal with the cosmic and the general, we deal only with
        the symbols of reality, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as soon as we deal with private and personal
        phenomena as such, we deal with realities in the completest sense of
        the term</span></em>. I think I can easily make clear what I mean by
        these words.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The world of our
        experience consists at all times of two parts, an objective and a
        subjective part, of which the former may be incalculably more
        extensive than the latter, and yet the latter can never be omitted or
        suppressed. The objective part is the sum total of whatsoever at any
        given time we may be thinking of, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page499">[pg 499]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg499"/> subjective part is the inner <span class="tei tei-q">“state”</span> in which the thinking comes to pass. What
        we think of may be enormous,—the cosmic times and spaces, for
        example,—whereas the inner state may be the most fugitive and paltry
        activity of mind. Yet the cosmic objects, so far as the experience
        yields them, are but ideal pictures of something whose existence we
        do not inwardly possess but only point at outwardly, while the inner
        state is our very experience itself; its reality and that of our
        experience are one. A conscious field <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plus</span></em> its
        object as felt or thought of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plus</span></em> an attitude towards the object
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plus</span></em> the sense of a self to whom the
        attitude belongs—such a concrete bit of personal experience may be a
        small bit, but it is a solid bit as long as it lasts; not hollow, not
        a mere abstract element of experience, such as the <span class="tei tei-q">“object”</span> is when taken all alone. It is a
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">full</span></em> fact, even though it be an
        insignificant fact; it is of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kind</span></em> to
        which all realities whatsoever must belong; the motor currents of the
        world run through the like of it; it is on the line connecting real
        events with real events. That unsharable feeling which each one of us
        has of the pinch of his individual destiny as he privately feels it
        rolling out on fortune's wheel may be disparaged for its egotism, may
        be sneered at as unscientific, but it is the one thing that fills up
        the measure of our concrete actuality, and any would-be existent that
        should lack such a feeling, or its analogue, would be a piece of
        reality only half made up.<a href="#note_334" id="noteref_334" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">334</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If this be true,
        it is absurd for science to say that the egotistic elements of
        experience should be suppressed. The axis of reality runs solely
        through the egotistic <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page500">[pg
        500]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg500"/>
        places,—they are strung upon it like so many beads. To describe the
        world with all the various feelings of the individual pinch of
        destiny, all the various spiritual attitudes, left out from the
        description—they being as describable as anything else—would be
        something like offering a printed bill of fare as the equivalent for
        a solid meal. Religion makes no such blunder. The individual's
        religion may be egotistic, and those private realities which it keeps
        in touch with may be narrow enough; but at any rate it always remains
        infinitely less hollow and abstract, as far as it goes, than a
        science which prides itself on taking no account of anything private
        at all.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A bill of fare
        with one real raisin on it instead of the word <span class="tei tei-q">“raisin,”</span> with one real egg instead of the word
        <span class="tei tei-q">“egg,”</span> might be an inadequate meal,
        but it would at least be a commencement of reality. The contention of
        the survival-theory that we ought to stick to non-personal elements
        exclusively seems like saying that we ought to be satisfied forever
        with reading the naked bill of fare. I think, therefore, that however
        particular questions connected with our individual destinies may be
        answered, it is only by acknowledging them as genuine questions, and
        living in the sphere of thought which they open up, that we become
        profound. But to live thus is to be religious; so I unhesitatingly
        repudiate the survival-theory of religion, as being founded on an
        egregious mistake. It does not follow, because our ancestors made so
        many errors of fact and mixed them with their religion, that we
        should therefore leave off being religious at all.<a href="#note_335" id="noteref_335" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">335</span></span></a> By
        being religious we establish ourselves in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page501">[pg 501]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg501"/> possession of ultimate reality at the only
        points at which reality is given us to guard. Our responsible concern
        is with our private destiny, after all.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">You see now why I
        have been so individualistic throughout these lectures, and why I
        have seemed so bent on rehabilitating the element of feeling in
        religion and subordinating its intellectual part. Individuality is
        founded in feeling; and the recesses of feeling, the darker, blinder
        strata of character, are the only places in the world in which we
        catch real fact in the making, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page502">[pg 502]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg502"/> directly perceive how events happen, and how
        work is actually done.<a href="#note_336" id="noteref_336" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">336</span></span></a>
        Compared with this world of living individualized feelings, the world
        of generalized objects which the intellect contemplates is without
        solidity or life. As in stereoscopic or kinetoscopic pictures seen
        outside the instrument, the third dimension, the movement, the vital
        element, are not there. We get a beautiful picture of an express
        train supposed to be moving, but where in the picture, as I have
        heard a friend say, is the energy or the fifty miles an hour?<a href="#note_337" id="noteref_337" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">337</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page503">[pg 503]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg503"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us agree,
        then, that Religion, occupying herself with personal destinies and
        keeping thus in contact with the only absolute realities which we
        know, must necessarily play an eternal part in human history. The
        next thing to decide is what she reveals about those destinies, or
        whether indeed she reveals anything distinct enough to be considered
        a general message to mankind. We have done as you see, with our
        preliminaries, and our final summing up can now begin.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I am well aware
        that after all the palpitating documents which I have quoted, and all
        the perspectives of emotion-inspiring institution and belief that my
        previous lectures have opened, the dry analysis to which I now
        advance may appear to many of you like an anti-climax, a tapering-off
        and flattening out of the subject, instead of a crescendo of interest
        and result. I said awhile ago that the religious attitude of
        Protestants appears poverty-stricken to the Catholic imagination.
        Still more poverty-stricken, I fear, may my final summing up of the
        subject appear at first to some of you. On which account I pray you
        now to bear this point in mind, that in the present part of it I am
        expressly trying to reduce religion to its lowest admissible terms,
        to that minimum, free from individualistic excrescences, which all
        religions contain as their nucleus, and on which it may be hoped that
        all religious persons may agree. That <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page504">[pg 504]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg504"/> established, we should have a result which
        might be small, but would at least be solid; and on it and round it
        the ruddier additional beliefs on which the different individuals
        make their venture might be grafted, and flourish as richly as you
        please. I shall add my own over-belief (which will be, I confess, of
        a somewhat pallid kind, as befits a critical philosopher), and you
        will, I hope, also add your over-beliefs, and we shall soon be in the
        varied world of concrete religious constructions once more. For the
        moment, let me dryly pursue the analytic part of the task.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both thought and
        feeling are determinants of conduct, and the same conduct may be
        determined either by feeling or by thought. When we survey the whole
        field of religion, we find a great variety in the thoughts that have
        prevailed there; but the feelings on the one hand and the conduct on
        the other are almost always the same, for Stoic, Christian, and
        Buddhist saints are practically indistinguishable in their lives. The
        theories which Religion generates, being thus variable, are
        secondary; and if you wish to grasp her essence, you must look to the
        feelings and the conduct as being the more constant elements. It is
        between these two elements that the short circuit exists on which she
        carries on her principal business, while the ideas and symbols and
        other institutions form loop-lines which may be perfections and
        improvements, and may even some day all be united into one harmonious
        system, but which are not to be regarded as organs with an
        indispensable function, necessary at all times for religious life to
        go on. This seems to me the first conclusion which we are entitled to
        draw from the phenomena we have passed in review.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next step is
        to characterize the feelings. To what psychological order do they
        belong?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page505">[pg
        505]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg505"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The resultant
        outcome of them is in any case what Kant calls a <span class="tei tei-q">“sthenic”</span> affection, an excitement of the
        cheerful, expansive, <span class="tei tei-q">“dynamogenic”</span>
        order which, like any tonic, freshens our vital powers. In almost
        every lecture, but especially in the lectures on Conversion and on
        Saintliness, we have seen how this emotion overcomes temperamental
        melancholy and imparts endurance to the Subject, or a zest, or a
        meaning, or an enchantment and glory to the common objects of
        life.<a href="#note_338" id="noteref_338" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">338</span></span></a> The
        name of <span class="tei tei-q">“faith-state,”</span> by which
        Professor Leuba designates it, is a good one.<a href="#note_339" id="noteref_339" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">339</span></span></a> It is a
        biological as well as a psychological condition, and Tolstoy is
        absolutely accurate in classing faith among the forces <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by which men
        live</span></em>.<a href="#note_340" id="noteref_340" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">340</span></span></a> The

        collapse.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The faith-state
        may hold a very minimum of intellectual content. We saw examples of
        this in those sudden raptures of the divine presence, or in such
        mystical seizures as Dr. Bucke described.<a href="#note_342" id="noteref_342" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a> It may
        be a mere vague enthusiasm, half spiritual, half vital, a courage,
        and a feeling that great and wondrous things are in the air.<a href="#note_343" id="noteref_343" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">343</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page506">[pg 506]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg506"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When, however, a
        positive intellectual content is associated with a faith-state, it
        gets invincibly stamped in upon belief,<a href="#note_344" id="noteref_344" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">344</span></span></a> and
        this explains the passionate loyalty of religious persons everywhere
        to the minutest details of their so widely differing creeds. Taking
        creeds and faith-state together, as forming <span class="tei tei-q">“religions,”</span> and treating these as purely
        subjective phenomena, without regard to the question of their
        <span class="tei tei-q">“truth,”</span> we are obliged, on account of
        their extraordinary influence upon action and endurance, to class
        them amongst the most important biological functions of mankind.
        Their stimulant and anæsthetic effect is so great that Professor
        Leuba, in a recent article,<a href="#note_345" id="noteref_345" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">345</span></span></a> goes so
        far as to say that so long as men can <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">use</span></em> their
        God, they care very little who he is, or even whether he is at all.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The truth of the matter can be put,”</span>
        says Leuba, <span class="tei tei-q">“in this way: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">God is not known, he
        is not understood; he is used</span></em>—sometimes as meat-purveyor,
        sometimes as moral support, sometimes as friend, sometimes as an
        object of love. If he proves himself useful, the religious
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page507">[pg 507]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg507"/> consciousness asks for no more
        than that. Does God really exist? How does he exist? What is he? are
        so many irrelevant questions. Not God, but life, more life, a larger,
        richer, more satisfying life, is, in the last analysis, the end of
        religion. The love of life, at any and every level of development, is
        the religious impulse.”</span><a href="#note_346" id="noteref_346" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">346</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this purely
        subjective rating, therefore, Religion must be considered vindicated
        in a certain way from the attacks of her critics. It would seem that
        she cannot be a mere anachronism and survival, but must exert a
        permanent function, whether she be with or without intellectual
        content, and whether, if she have any, it be true or false.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We must next pass
        beyond the point of view of merely subjective utility, and make
        inquiry into the intellectual content itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First, is there,
        under all the discrepancies of the creeds, a common nucleus to which
        they bear their testimony unanimously?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And second, ought
        we to consider the testimony true?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I will take up the
        first question first, and answer it immediately in the affirmative.
        The warring gods and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page508">[pg
        508]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg508"/>
        formulas of the various religions do indeed cancel each other, but
        there is a certain uniform deliverance in which religions all appear
        to meet. It consists of two parts:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. An uneasiness;
        and</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. Its
        solution.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. The uneasiness,
        reduced to its simplest terms, is a sense that there is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">something wrong about
        us</span></em> as we naturally stand.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. The solution is
        a sense that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we are saved from the wrongness</span></em> by
        making proper connection with the higher powers.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In those more
        developed minds which alone we are studying, the wrongness takes a
        moral character, and the salvation takes a mystical tinge. I think we
        shall keep well within the limits of what is common to all such minds
        if we formulate the essence of their religious experience in terms
        like these:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The individual, so
        far as he suffers from his wrongness and criticises it, is to that
        extent consciously beyond it, and in at least possible touch with
        something higher, if anything higher exist. Along with the wrong part
        there is thus a better part of him, even though it may be but a most
        helpless germ. With which part he should identify his real being is
        by no means obvious at this stage; but when stage 2 (the stage of
        solution or salvation) arrives,<a href="#note_347" id="noteref_347" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">347</span></span></a> the man
        identifies his real being with the germinal higher part of himself;
        and does so in the following way. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">He becomes conscious
        that this higher part is conterminous and continuous with a</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">more</span></span> <span style="font-style: italic">of the same quality, which is operative in the
        universe outside of him, and which he can keep in working touch with,
        and in a fashion get on board of and save himself when all his lower
        being has gone to pieces in the wreck.</span></em></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page509">[pg 509]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg509"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seems to me
        that all the phenomena are accurately describable in these very
        simple general terms.<a href="#note_348" id="noteref_348" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">348</span></span></a> They
        allow for the divided self and the struggle; they involve the change
        of personal centre and the surrender of the lower self; they express
        the appearance of exteriority of the helping power and yet account
        for our sense of union with it;<a href="#note_349" id="noteref_349" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a> and
        they fully justify our feelings of security and joy. There is
        probably no autobiographic document, among all those which I have
        quoted, to which the description will not well apply. One need only
        add such specific details as will adapt it to various theologies and
        various personal temperaments, and one will then have the various
        experiences reconstructed in their individual forms.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far, however,
        as this analysis goes, the experiences are only psychological
        phenomena. They possess, it is true, enormous biological worth.
        Spiritual strength really increases in the subject when he has them,
        a new life opens for him, and they seem to him a place of conflux
        where the forces of two universes meet; and yet this may be nothing
        but his subjective way of feeling things, a mood of his own fancy, in
        spite of the effects produced. I now turn to my second question: What
        is the objective <span class="tei tei-q">“truth”</span> of their
        content?<a href="#note_350" id="noteref_350" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">350</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The part of the
        content concerning which the question <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page510">[pg 510]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg510"/> of truth most pertinently arises is that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">more</span></span> of the same
        quality”</span> with which our own higher self appears in the
        experience to come into harmonious working relation. Is such a
        <span class="tei tei-q">“more”</span> merely our own notion, or does
        it really exist? If so, in what shape does it exist? Does it act, as
        well as exist? And in what form should we conceive of that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“union”</span> with it of which religious
        geniuses are so convinced?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is in answering
        these questions that the various theologies perform their theoretic
        work, and that their divergencies most come to light. They all agree
        that the <span class="tei tei-q">“more”</span> really exists; though
        some of them hold it to exist in the shape of a personal god or gods,
        while others are satisfied to conceive it as a stream of ideal
        tendency embedded in the eternal structure of the world. They all
        agree, moreover, that it acts as well as exists, and that something
        really is effected for the better when you throw your life into its
        hands. It is when they treat of the experience of <span class="tei tei-q">“union”</span> with it that their speculative differences
        appear most clearly. Over this point pantheism and theism, nature and
        second birth, works and grace and karma, immortality and
        reincarnation, rationalism and mysticism, carry on inveterate

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the end of my
        lecture on Philosophy<a href="#note_351" id="noteref_351" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">351</span></span></a> I held
        out the notion that an impartial science of religions might sift out
        from the midst of their discrepancies a common body of doctrine which
        she might also formulate in terms to which physical science need not
        object. This, I said, she might adopt as her own reconciling
        hypothesis, and recommend it for general belief. I also said that in
        my last lecture I should have to try my own hand at framing such an
        hypothesis.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The time has now
        come for this attempt. Who says <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page511">[pg 511]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg511"/> <span class="tei tei-q">“hypothesis”</span>
        renounces the ambition to be coercive in his arguments. The most I
        can do is, accordingly, to offer something that may fit the facts so
        easily that your scientific logic will find no plausible pretext for
        vetoing your impulse to welcome it as true.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class="tei tei-q">“more,”</span> as we called it, and the meaning of our
        <span class="tei tei-q">“union”</span> with it, form the nucleus of
        our inquiry. Into what definite description can these words be
        translated, and for what definite facts do they stand? It would never
        do for us to place ourselves offhand at the position of a particular
        theology, the Christian theology, for example, and proceed
        immediately to define the <span class="tei tei-q">“more”</span> as
        Jehovah, and the <span class="tei tei-q">“union”</span> as his
        imputation to us of the righteousness of Christ. That would be unfair
        to other religions, and, from our present standpoint at least, would
        be an over-belief.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We must begin by
        using less particularized terms; and, since one of the duties of the
        science of religions is to keep religion in connection with the rest
        of science, we shall do well to seek first of all a way of describing
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“more,”</span> which psychologists may
        also recognize as real. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subconscious self</span></em> is nowadays a
        well-accredited psychological entity; and I believe that in it we
        have exactly the mediating term required. Apart from all religious
        considerations, there is actually and literally more life in our
        total soul than we are at any time aware of. The exploration of the
        transmarginal field has hardly yet been seriously undertaken, but
        what Mr. Myers said in 1892 in his essay on the Subliminal
        Consciousness<a href="#note_352" id="noteref_352" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">352</span></span></a> is
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page512">[pg 512]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg512"/> as true as when it was first
        written: <span class="tei tei-q">“Each of us is in reality an abiding
        psychical entity far more extensive than he knows—an individuality
        which can never express itself completely through any corporeal
        manifestation. The Self manifests through the organism; but there is
        always some part of the Self unmanifested; and always, as it seems,
        some power of organic expression in abeyance or
        reserve.”</span><a href="#note_353" id="noteref_353" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">353</span></span></a> Much of
        the content of this larger background against which our conscious
        being stands out in relief is insignificant. Imperfect memories,
        silly jingles, inhibitive timidities, <span class="tei tei-q">“dissolutive”</span> phenomena of various sorts, as Myers
        calls them, enter into it for a large part. But in it many of the
        performances of genius seem also to have their origin; and in our
        study of conversion, of mystical experiences, and of prayer, we have
        seen how striking a part invasions from this region play in the
        religious life.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let me then
        propose, as an hypothesis, that whatever it may be on its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">farther</span></em>
        side, the <span class="tei tei-q">“more”</span> with which in
        religious experience we feel ourselves connected is on its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hither</span></em>
        side the subconscious continuation of our conscious life. Starting
        thus with a recognized psychological fact as our basis, we seem to
        preserve a contact with <span class="tei tei-q">“science”</span>
        which the ordinary theologian lacks. At the same time the
        theologian's contention that the religious man is moved by an
        external power is vindicated, for it is one of the peculiarities of
        invasions from the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page513">[pg
        513]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg513"/>
        subconscious region to take on objective appearances, and to suggest
        to the Subject an external control. In the religious life the control
        is felt as <span class="tei tei-q">“higher”</span>; but since on our
        hypothesis it is primarily the higher faculties of our own hidden
        mind which are controlling, the sense of union with the power beyond
        us is a sense of something, not merely apparently, but literally
        true.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This doorway into
        the subject seems to me the best one for a science of religions, for
        it mediates between a number of different points of view. Yet it is
        only a doorway, and difficulties present themselves as soon as we
        step through it, and ask how far our transmarginal consciousness
        carries us if we follow it on its remoter side. Here the over-beliefs
        begin: here mysticism and the conversion-rapture and Vedantism and
        transcendental idealism bring in their monistic interpretations<a href="#note_354" id="noteref_354" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">354</span></span></a> and
        tell us that the finite self rejoins the absolute self, for it was
        always one with God and identical with the soul of the world.<a href="#note_355" id="noteref_355" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">355</span></span></a> Here
        the prophets of all the different religions <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page514">[pg 514]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg514"/> come with their visions, voices, raptures, and
        other openings, supposed by each to authenticate his own peculiar
        faith.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those of us who
        are not personally favored with such specific revelations must stand
        outside of them altogether and, for the present at least, decide
        that, since they corroborate incompatible theological doctrines, they
        neutralize one another and leave no fixed result. If we follow any
        one of them, or if we follow philosophical theory and embrace
        monistic pantheism on non-mystical grounds, we do so in the exercise
        of our individual freedom, and build out our religion in the way most
        congruous with our personal susceptibilities. Among these
        susceptibilities intellectual ones play a decisive part. Although the
        religious question is primarily a question of life, of living or not
        living in the higher union which opens itself to us as a gift, yet
        the spiritual excitement in which the gift appears a real one will
        often fail to be aroused in an individual until certain particular
        intellectual beliefs or ideas which, as we say, come home to him, are
        touched.<a href="#note_356" id="noteref_356" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">356</span></span></a> These
        ideas will thus be essential to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page515">[pg 515]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg515"/> that individual's religion;—which is as much as
        to say that over-beliefs in various directions are absolutely
        indispensable, and that we should treat them with tenderness and
        tolerance so long as they are not intolerant themselves. As I have
        elsewhere written, the most interesting and valuable things about a
        man are usually his over-beliefs.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Disregarding the
        over-beliefs, and confining ourselves to what is common and generic,
        we have in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the fact that the conscious person is continuous
        with a wider self through which saving experiences
        come</span></em>,<a href="#note_357" id="noteref_357" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">357</span></span></a> a
        positive content of religious experience which, it seems to me,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is
        literally and objectively true as far as it goes</span></em>. If I
        now proceed to state my own hypothesis about the farther limits of
        this extension of our personality, I shall be offering my own
        over-belief—though I know it will appear a sorry under-belief to some
        of you—for which I can only bespeak the same indulgence which in a
        converse case I should accord to yours.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%"/>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The further limits
        of our being plunge, it seems to me, into an altogether other
        dimension of existence from the sensible and merely <span class="tei tei-q">“understandable”</span> world. Name it the mystical
        region, or the supernatural region, whichever you <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page516">[pg 516]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg516"/> choose. So far as our ideal impulses
        originate in this region (and most of them do originate in it, for we
        find them possessing us in a way for which we cannot articulately
        account), we belong to it in a more intimate sense than that in which
        we belong to the visible world, for we belong in the most intimate
        sense wherever our ideals belong. Yet the unseen region in question
        is not merely ideal, for it produces effects in this world. When we
        commune with it, work is actually done upon our finite personality,
        for we are turned into new men, and consequences in the way of
        conduct follow in the natural world upon our regenerative
        change.<a href="#note_358" id="noteref_358" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">358</span></span></a> But
        that which produces effects within another reality must be termed a
        reality itself, so I feel as if we had no philosophic excuse for
        calling the unseen or mystical world unreal.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">God is the natural
        appellation, for us Christians at least, for the supreme reality, so
        I will call this higher part of the universe by the name of
        God.<a href="#note_359" id="noteref_359" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">359</span></span></a> We and
        God <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page517">[pg 517]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg517"/> have business with
        each other; and in opening ourselves to his influence our deepest
        destiny is fulfilled. The universe, at those parts of it which our
        personal being constitutes, takes a turn genuinely for the worse or
        for the better in proportion as each one of us fulfills or evades
        God's demands. As far as this goes I probably have you with me, for I
        only translate into schematic language what I may call the
        instinctive belief of mankind: God is real since he produces real
        effects.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The real effects
        in question, so far as I have as yet admitted them, are exerted on
        the personal centres of energy of the various subjects, but the
        spontaneous faith of most of the subjects is that they embrace a
        wider sphere than this. Most religious men believe (or <span class="tei tei-q">“know,”</span> if they be mystical) that not only they
        themselves, but the whole universe of beings to whom the God is
        present, are secure in his parental hands. There is a sense, a
        dimension, they are sure, in which we are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em>
        saved, in spite of the gates of hell and all adverse terrestrial
        appearances. God's existence is the guarantee of an ideal order that
        shall be permanently preserved. This world may indeed, as science
        assures us, some day burn up or freeze; but if it is part of his
        order, the old ideals are sure to be brought elsewhere to fruition,
        so that where God is, tragedy is only provisional and partial, and
        shipwreck and dissolution are not the absolutely final things. Only
        when this farther step of faith concerning God is taken, and remote
        objective consequences are predicted, does religion, as it seems to
        me, get wholly free from the first immediate subjective experience,
        and bring a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real hypothesis</span></em> into play. A good
        hypothesis in science must have <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page518">[pg 518]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg518"/> other properties than those of the phenomenon
        it is immediately invoked to explain, otherwise it is not prolific
        enough. God, meaning only what enters into the religious man's
        experience of union, falls short of being an hypothesis of this more
        useful order. He needs to enter into wider cosmic relations in order
        to justify the subject's absolute confidence and peace.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the God with
        whom, starting from the hither side of our own extra-marginal self,
        we come at its remoter margin into commerce should be the absolute
        world-ruler, is of course a very considerable over-belief.
        Over-belief as it is, though, it is an article of almost every one's
        religion. Most of us pretend in some way to prop it upon our
        philosophy, but the philosophy itself is really propped upon this
        faith. What is this but to say that Religion, in her fullest exercise
        of function, is not a mere illumination of facts already elsewhere
        given, not a mere passion, like love, which views things in a rosier
        light. It is indeed that, as we have seen abundantly. But it is
        something more, namely, a postulator of new <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">facts</span></em> as
        well. The world interpreted religiously is not the materialistic
        world over again, with an altered expression; it must have, over and
        above the altered expression, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a natural constitution</span></em> different at
        some point from that which a materialistic world would have. It must
        be such that different events can be expected in it, different
        conduct must be required.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This thoroughly
        <span class="tei tei-q">“pragmatic”</span> view of religion has
        usually been taken as a matter of course by common men. They have
        interpolated divine miracles into the field of nature, they have
        built a heaven out beyond the grave. It is only transcendentalist
        metaphysicians who think that, without adding any concrete details to
        Nature, or subtracting any, but by simply calling it the expression
        of absolute spirit, you make it more divine just as it
        stands.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page519">[pg
        519]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg519"/>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I believe the
        pragmatic way of taking religion to be the deeper way. It gives it
        body as well as soul, it makes it claim, as everything real must
        claim, some characteristic realm of fact as its very own. What the
        more characteristically divine facts are, apart from the actual
        inflow of energy in the faith-state and the prayer-state, I know not.
        But the over-belief on which I am ready to make my personal venture
        is that they exist. The whole drift of my education goes to persuade
        me that the world of our present consciousness is only one out of
        many worlds of consciousness that exist, and that those other worlds
        must contain experiences which have a meaning for our life also; and
        that although in the main their experiences and those of this world
        keep discrete, yet the two become continuous at certain points, and
        higher energies filter in. By being faithful in my poor measure to
        this over-belief, I seem to myself to keep more sane and true. I
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></em>, of course, put myself into the
        sectarian scientist's attitude, and imagine vividly that the world of
        sensations and of scientific laws and objects may be all. But
        whenever I do this, I hear that inward monitor of which W. K.
        Clifford once wrote, whispering the word <span class="tei tei-q">“bosh!”</span> Humbug is humbug, even though it bear the
        scientific name, and the total expression of human experience, as I
        view it objectively, invincibly urges me beyond the narrow
        <span class="tei tei-q">“scientific”</span> bounds. Assuredly, the
        real world is of a different temperament,—more intricately built than
        physical science allows. So my objective and my subjective conscience
        both hold me to the over-belief which I express. Who knows whether
        the faithfulness of individuals here below to their own poor
        over-beliefs may not actually help God in turn to be more effectively
        faithful to his own greater tasks?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In writing my
        concluding lecture I had to aim so much at simplification that I fear
        that my general philosophic position received so scant a statement as
        hardly to be intelligible to some of my readers. I therefore add this
        epilogue, which must also be so brief as possibly to remedy but
        little the defect. In a later work I may be enabled to state my
        position more amply and consequently more clearly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Originality cannot
        be expected in a field like this, where all the attitudes and tempers
        that are possible have been exhibited in literature long ago, and
        where any new writer can immediately be classed under a familiar
        head. If one should make a division of all thinkers into naturalists
        and supernaturalists, I should undoubtedly have to go, along with
        most philosophers, into the supernaturalist branch. But there is a
        crasser and a more refined supernaturalism, and it is to the refined
        division that most philosophers at the present day belong. If not
        regular transcendental idealists, they at least obey the Kantian
        direction enough to bar out ideal entities from interfering causally
        in the course of phenomenal events. Refined supernaturalism is
        universalistic supernaturalism; for the <span class="tei tei-q">“crasser”</span> variety <span class="tei tei-q">“piecemeal”</span> supernaturalism would perhaps be the
        better name. It went with that older theology which to-day is
        supposed to reign only among uneducated people, or to be found among
        the few belated professors of the dualisms which Kant is thought to
        have displaced. It admits miracles <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page521">[pg 521]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg521"/> and providential leadings, and finds no
        intellectual difficulty in mixing the ideal and the real worlds
        together by interpolating influences from the ideal region among the
        forces that causally determine the real world's details. In this the
        refined supernaturalists think that it muddles disparate dimensions
        of existence. For them the world of the ideal has no efficient
        causality, and never bursts into the world of phenomena at particular
        points. The ideal world, for them, is not a world of facts, but only
        of the meaning of facts; it is a point of view for judging facts. It
        appertains to a different <span class="tei tei-q">“-ology,”</span>
        and inhabits a different dimension of being altogether from that in
        which existential propositions obtain. It cannot get down upon the
        flat level of experience and interpolate itself piecemeal between
        distinct portions of nature, as those who believe, for example, in
        divine aid coming in response to prayer, are bound to think it
        must.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding my
        own inability to accept either popular Christianity or scholastic
        theism, I suppose that my belief that in communion with the Ideal new
        force comes into the world, and new departures are made here below,
        subjects me to being classed among the supernaturalists of the
        piecemeal or crasser type. Universalistic supernaturalism surrenders,
        it seems to me, too easily to naturalism. It takes the facts of
        physical science at their face-value, and leaves the laws of life
        just as naturalism finds them, with no hope of remedy, in case their
        fruits are bad. It confines itself to sentiments about life as a
        whole, sentiments which may be admiring and adoring, but which need
        not be so, as the existence of systematic pessimism proves. In this
        universalistic way of taking the ideal world, the essence of
        practical religion seems to me to evaporate. Both instinctively and
        for logical reasons, I find it hard to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page522">[pg 522]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg522"/> believe that principles can exist which make no
        difference in facts.<a href="#note_360" id="noteref_360" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">360</span></span></a> But all
        facts are particular facts, and the whole interest of the question of
        God's existence seems to me to lie in the consequences for
        particulars which that existence may be expected to entail. That no
        concrete particular of experience should alter its complexion in
        consequence of a God being there seems to me an incredible
        proposition, and yet it is the thesis to which (implicitly at any
        rate) refined supernaturalism seems to cling. It is only with
        experience <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">en bloc</span></span>, it says, that the
        Absolute maintains relations. It condescends to no transactions of
        detail.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I am ignorant of
        Buddhism and speak under correction, and merely in order the better
        to describe my general point of view; but as I apprehend the
        Buddhistic doctrine of Karma, I agree in principle with that. All
        supernaturalists admit that facts are under the judgment of higher
        law; but for Buddhism as I interpret it, and for religion generally
        so far as it remains unweakened by transcendentalistic metaphysics,
        the word <span class="tei tei-q">“judgment”</span> here means no such
        bare academic verdict or platonic appreciation as it means in
        Vedantic or modern absolutist systems; it carries, on the contrary,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">execution</span></em> with it, is <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page523">[pg 523]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg523"/><span style="font-style: italic">rebus</span></span> as well as <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">post rem</span></span>, and operates
        <span class="tei tei-q">“causally”</span> as partial factor in the
        total fact. The universe becomes a gnosticism<a href="#note_361" id="noteref_361" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">361</span></span></a> pure
        and simple on any other terms. But this view that judgment and
        execution go together is that of the crasser supernaturalist way of
        thinking, so the present volume must on the whole be classed with the
        other expressions of that creed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I state the matter
        thus bluntly, because the current of thought in academic circles runs
        against me, and I feel like a man who must set his back against an
        open door quickly if he does not wish to see it closed and locked. In
        spite of its being so shocking to the reigning intellectual tastes, I
        believe that a candid consideration of piecemeal supernaturalism and
        a complete discussion of all its metaphysical bearings will show it
        to be the hypothesis by which the largest number of legitimate
        requirements are met. That of course would be a program for other
        books than this; what I now say sufficiently indicates to the
        philosophic reader the place where I belong.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If asked just
        where the differences in fact which are due to God's existence come
        in, I should have to say that in general I have no hypothesis to
        offer beyond what the phenomenon of <span class="tei tei-q">“prayerful communion,”</span> especially when certain
        kinds of incursion from the subconscious region take part in it,
        immediately suggests. The appearance is that in this phenomenon
        something ideal, which in one sense is part of ourselves and in
        another sense is not ourselves, actually exerts an influence, raises
        our centre of personal energy, and produces regenerative effects
        unattainable in other ways. If, then, there be a wider world of being
        than that of our every-day consciousness, if in it there be forces
        whose effects on us are intermittent, if <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page524">[pg 524]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg524"/> one facilitating condition of the effects be
        the openness of the <span class="tei tei-q">“subliminal”</span> door,
        we have the elements of a theory to which the phenomena of religious
        life lend plausibility. I am so impressed by the importance of these
        phenomena that I adopt the hypothesis which they so naturally
        suggest. At these places at least, I say, it would seem as though
        transmundane energies, God, if you will, produced immediate effects
        within the natural world to which the rest of our experience
        belongs.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The difference in
        natural <span class="tei tei-q">“fact”</span> which most of us would
        assign as the first difference which the existence of a God ought to
        make would, I imagine, be personal immortality. Religion, in fact,
        for the great majority of our own race <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">means</span></em>
        immortality, and nothing else. God is the producer of immortality;
        and whoever has doubts of immortality is written down as an atheist
        without farther trial. I have said nothing in my lectures about
        immortality or the belief therein, for to me it seems a secondary
        point. If our ideals are only cared for in <span class="tei tei-q">“eternity,”</span> I do not see why we might not be
        willing to resign their care to other hands than ours. Yet I
        sympathize with the urgent impulse to be present ourselves, and in
        the conflict of impulses, both of them so vague yet both of them
        noble, I know not how to decide. It seems to me that it is eminently
        a case for facts to testify. Facts, I think, are yet lacking to prove
        <span class="tei tei-q">“spirit-return,”</span> though I have the
        highest respect for the patient labors of Messrs. Myers, Hodgson, and
        Hyslop, and am somewhat impressed by their favorable conclusions. I
        consequently leave the matter open, with this brief word to save the
        reader from a possible perplexity as to why immortality got no
        mention in the body of this book.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ideal power
        with which we feel ourselves in connection, the <span class="tei tei-q">“God”</span> of ordinary men, is, both by ordinary
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page525">[pg 525]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg525"/> men and by philosophers,
        endowed with certain of those metaphysical attributes which in the
        lecture on philosophy I treated with such disrespect. He is assumed
        as a matter of course to be <span class="tei tei-q">“one and
        only”</span> and to be <span class="tei tei-q">“infinite”</span>; and
        the notion of many finite gods is one which hardly any one thinks it
        worth while to consider, and still less to uphold. Nevertheless, in
        the interests of intellectual clearness, I feel bound to say that
        religious experience, as we have studied it, cannot be cited as
        unequivocally supporting the infinitist belief. The only thing that
        it unequivocally testifies to is that we can experience union with
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">something</span></em> larger than ourselves and
        in that union find our greatest peace. Philosophy, with its passion
        for unity, and mysticism with its monoideistic bent, both
        <span class="tei tei-q">“pass to the limit”</span> and identify the
        something with a unique God who is the all-inclusive soul of the
        world. Popular opinion, respectful to their authority, follows the
        example which they set.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the
        practical needs and experiences of religion seem to me sufficiently
        met by the belief that beyond each man and in a fashion continuous
        with him there exists a larger power which is friendly to him and to
        his ideals. All that the facts require is that the power should be
        both other and larger than our conscious selves. Anything larger will
        do, if only it be large enough to trust for the next step. It need
        not be infinite, it need not be solitary. It might conceivably even
        be only a larger and more godlike self, of which the present self
        would then be but the mutilated expression, and the universe might
        conceivably be a collection of such selves, of different degrees of
        inclusiveness, with no absolute unity realized in it at all.<a href="#note_362" id="noteref_362" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">362</span></span></a> Thus
        would a sort of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page526">[pg
        526]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg526"/>
        polytheism return upon us—a polytheism which I do not on this
        occasion defend, for my only aim at present is to keep the testimony
        of religious experience clearly within its proper bounds. [Compare p.
        <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Pg132">132</a> above.]</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upholders of the
        monistic view will say to such a polytheism (which, by the way, has
        always been the real religion of common people, and is so still
        to-day) that unless there be one all-inclusive God, our guarantee of
        security is left imperfect. In the Absolute, and in the Absolute
        only, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> is saved. If there be different
        gods, each caring for his part, some portion of some of us might not
        be covered with divine protection, and our religious consolation
        would thus fail to be complete. It goes back to what was said on
        pages <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Pg131">131-133</a>, about the
        possibility of there being portions of the universe that may
        irretrievably be lost. Common sense is less sweeping in its demands
        than philosophy or mysticism have been wont to be, and can suffer the
        notion of this world being partly saved and partly lost. The ordinary
        moralistic state of mind makes the salvation of the world conditional
        upon the success with which each unit does its part. Partial and
        conditional salvation is in fact a most familiar notion when taken in
        the abstract, the only difficulty being to determine the details.
        Some men are even disinterested enough to be willing to be in the
        unsaved remnant as far as their persons go, if only they can be
        persuaded that their cause will prevail—all of us are willing,
        whenever our activity-excitement rises sufficiently high. I think, in
        fact, that a final philosophy of religion will have to consider the
        pluralistic hypothesis more seriously than it has hitherto been
        willing to consider it. For practical life at any rate, the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chance</span></em> of salvation is enough. No
        fact in human nature is more characteristic than its willingness to
        live on a chance. The existence of the chance makes <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page527">[pg 527]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg527"/> the difference, as Edmund Gurney says,
        between a life of which the keynote is resignation and a life of
        which the keynote is hope.<a href="#note_363" id="noteref_363" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">363</span></span></a> But all
        these statements are unsatisfactory from their brevity, and I can
        only say that I hope to return to the same questions in another
        book.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As with many
            ideas that float in the air of one's time, this notion shrinks
            from dogmatic general statement and expresses itself only
            partially and by innuendo. It seems to me that few conceptions
            are less instructive than this re-interpretation of religion as
            perverted sexuality. It reminds one, so crudely is it often
            employed, of the famous Catholic taunt, that the Reformation may
            be best understood by remembering that its <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fons et origo</span></span> was Luther's
            wish to marry a nun:—the effects are infinitely wider than the
            alleged causes, and for the most part opposite in nature. It is
            true that in the vast collection of religious phenomena, some are
            undisguisedly amatory—e.g., sex-deities and obscene rites in
            polytheism, and ecstatic feelings of union with the Saviour in a
            few Christian mystics. But then why not equally call religion an
            aberration of the digestive function, and prove one's point by
            the worship of Bacchus and Ceres, or by the ecstatic feelings of
            some other saints about the Eucharist? Religious language clothes
            itself in such poor symbols as our life affords, and the whole
            organism gives overtones of comment whenever the mind is strongly
            stirred to expression. Language drawn from eating and drinking is
            probably as common in religious literature as is language drawn
            from the sexual life. We <span class="tei tei-q">“hunger and
            thirst”</span> after righteousness; we <span class="tei tei-q">“find the Lord a sweet savor;”</span> we <span class="tei tei-q">“taste and see that he is good.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Spiritual milk for American babes, drawn from the
            breasts of both testaments,”</span> is a sub-title of the once
            famous New England Primer, and Christian devotional literature
            indeed quite floats in milk, thought of from the point of view,
            not of the mother, but of the greedy babe.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saint François
            de Sales, for instance, thus describes the <span class="tei tei-q">“orison of quietude”</span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“In this state the soul is like a little child still
            at the breast, whose mother, to caress him whilst he is still in
            her arms, makes her milk distill into his mouth without his even
            moving his lips. So it is here.... Our Lord desires that our will
            should be satisfied with sucking the milk which His Majesty pours
            into our mouth, and that we should relish the sweetness without
            even knowing that it cometh from the Lord.”</span> And again:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Consider the little infants, united and
            joined to the breasts of their nursing mothers, you will see that
            from time to time they press themselves closer by little starts
            to which the pleasure of sucking prompts them. Even so, during
            its orison, the heart united to its God oftentimes makes attempts
            at closer union by movements during which it presses closer upon
            the divine sweetness.”</span> Chemin de la Perfection, ch. xxxi.;
            Amour de Dieu, vii. ch. i.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In fact, one
            might almost as well interpret religion as a perversion of the
            respiratory function. The Bible is full of the language of
            respiratory oppression: <span class="tei tei-q">“Hide not thine
            ear at my breathing; my groaning is not hid from thee; my heart
            panteth, my strength faileth me; my bones are hot with my roaring
            all the night long; as the hart panteth after the water-brooks,
            so my soul panteth after thee, O my God.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">God's Breath in
            Man</span></span> is the title of the chief work of our best
            known American mystic (Thomas Lake Harris); and in certain
            non-Christian countries the foundation of all religious
            discipline consists in regulation of the inspiration and
            expiration.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These
            arguments are as good as much of the reasoning one hears in favor
            of the sexual theory. But the champions of the latter will then
            say that their chief argument has no analogue elsewhere. The two
            main phenomena of religion, namely, melancholy and conversion,
            they will say, are essentially phenomena of adolescence, and
            therefore synchronous with the development of sexual life. To
            which the retort again is easy. Even were the asserted synchrony
            unrestrictedly true as a fact (which it is not), it is not only
            the sexual life, but the entire higher mental life which awakens
            during adolescence. One might then as well set up the thesis that
            the interest in mechanics, physics, chemistry, logic, philosophy,
            and sociology, which springs up during adolescent years along
            with that in poetry and religion, is also a perversion of the
            sexual instinct:—but that would be too absurd. Moreover, if the
            argument from synchrony is to decide, what is to be done with the
            fact that the religious age <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">par
            excellence</span></span> would seem to be old age, when the
            uproar of the sexual life is past?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The plain
            truth is that to interpret religion one must in the end look at
            the immediate content of the religious consciousness. The moment
            one does this, one sees how wholly disconnected it is in the main
            from the content of the sexual consciousness. Everything about
            the two things differs, objects, moods, faculties concerned, and
            acts impelled to. Any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">general</span></em> assimilation is simply
            impossible: what we find most often is complete hostility and
            contrast. If now the defenders of the sex-theory say that this
            makes no difference to their thesis; that without the chemical
            contributions which the sex-organs make to the blood, the brain
            would not be nourished so as to carry on religious activities,
            this final proposition may be true or not true; but at any rate
            it has become profoundly uninstructive: we can deduce no
            consequences from it which help us to interpret religion's
            meaning or value. In this sense the religious life depends just
            as much upon the spleen, the pancreas, and the kidneys as on the
            sexual apparatus, and the whole theory has lost its point in
            evaporating into a vague general assertion of the dependence,

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">Lest my own testimony be suspected, I
          will quote another reporter, Dr. H. H. Goddard, of Clark
          University, whose thesis on <span class="tei tei-q">“the Effects of
          Mind on Body as evidenced by Faith Cures”</span> is published in
          the American Journal of Psychology for 1899 (vol. x.). This critic,
          after a wide study of the facts, concludes that the cures by
          mind-cure exist, but are in no respect different from those now
          officially recognized in medicine as cures by suggestion; and the
          end of his essay contains an interesting physiological speculation
          as to the way in which the suggestive ideas may work (p. 67 of the
          reprint). As regards the general phenomenon of mental cure itself,
          Dr. Goddard writes: <span class="tei tei-q">“In spite of the severe
          criticism we have made of reports of cure, there still remains a
          vast amount of material, showing a powerful influence of the mind
          in disease. Many cases are of diseases that have been diagnosed and
          treated by the best physicians of the country, or which prominent
          hospitals have tried their hand at curing, but without success.
          People of culture and education have been treated by this method
          with satisfactory results. Diseases of long standing have been
          ameliorated, and even cured.... We have traced the mental element
          through primitive medicine and folk-medicine of to-day, patent
          medicine, and witchcraft. We are convinced that it is impossible to
          account for the existence of these practices, if they did not cure
          disease, and that if they cured disease, it must have been the
          mental element that was effective. The same argument applies to
          those modern schools of mental therapeutics—Divine Healing and
          Christian Science. It is hardly conceivable that the large body of
          intelligent people who comprise the body known distinctively as
          Mental Scientists should continue to exist if the whole thing were
          a delusion. It is not a thing of a day; it is not confined to a
          few; it is not local. It is true that many failures are recorded,
          but that only adds to the argument. There must be many and striking
          successes to counterbalance the failures, otherwise the failures
          would have ended the delusion.... Christian Science, Divine
          Healing, or Mental Science do not, and never can in the very nature
          of things, cure all diseases; nevertheless, the practical
          applications of the general principles of the broadest mental
          science will tend to prevent disease.... We do find sufficient
          evidence to convince us that the proper reform in mental attitude
          would relieve many a sufferer of ills that the ordinary physician
          cannot touch; would even delay the approach of death to many a
          victim beyond the power of absolute cure, and the faithful
          adherence to a truer philosophy of life will keep many a man well,
          and give the doctor time to devote to alleviating ills that are
          unpreventable”</span> (pp. 33, 34 of reprint).</dd>

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">Whether it differs so much from
          Christ's own notion is for the exegetists to decide. According to
          Harnack, Jesus felt about evil and disease much as our mind-curers
          do. <span class="tei tei-q">“What is the answer which Jesus sends
          to John the Baptist?”</span> asks Harnack, and says it is this:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘The blind see,
          and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the
          dead rise up, and the gospel is preached to the poor.’</span> That
          is the <span class="tei tei-q">‘coming of the kingdom,’</span> or
          rather in these saving works the kingdom is already there. By the
          overcoming and removal of misery, of need, of sickness, by these
          actual effects John is to see that the new time has arrived. The
          casting out of devils is only a part of this work of redemption,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">but Jesus
          points to that as the sense and seal of his mission</span></em>.
          Thus to the wretched, sick, and poor did he address himself, but
          not as a moralist, and without a trace of sentimentalism. He never
          makes groups and departments of the ills; he never spends time in
          asking whether the sick one <span class="tei tei-q">‘deserves’</span> to be cured; and it never occurs to
          him to sympathize with the pain or the death. He nowhere says that
          sickness is a beneficent infliction, and that evil has a healthy
          use. No, he calls sickness sickness and health health. All evil,
          all wretchedness, is for him something dreadful; it is of the great
          kingdom of Satan; but he feels the power of the Saviour within him.
          He knows that advance is possible only when weakness is overcome,
          when sickness is made well.”</span> Das Wesen des Christenthums,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The declaration made in the beginning of the
            ministry of Jesus that <span class="tei tei-q">‘the time is
            fulfilled, and the kingdom of heaven is at hand,’</span> passes
            with scarce a break into the announcement that <span class="tei tei-q">‘the kingdom of God is among you’</span>; and the
            importance of this announcement is asserted to be such that it
            makes, so to speak, a difference <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in
            kind</span></em> between the greatest saints and prophets who
            lived under the previous reign of division, and <span class="tei tei-q">‘the least in the kingdom of heaven.’</span> The
            highest ideal is brought close to men and declared to be within
            their reach, they are called on to be <span class="tei tei-q">‘perfect as their Father in heaven is
            perfect.’</span> The sense of alienation and distance from God
            which had grown upon the pious in Israel just in proportion as
            they had learned to look upon Him as no mere national divinity,
            but as a God of justice who would punish Israel for its sin as
            certainly as Edom or Moab, is declared to be no longer in place;
            and the typical form of Christian prayer points to the abolition
            of the contrast between this world and the next which through all
            the history of the Jews had continually been growing wider:
            <span class="tei tei-q">‘As in heaven, so on earth.’</span> The
            sense of the division of man from God, as a finite being from the
            Infinite, as weak and sinful from the Omnipotent Goodness, is not
            indeed lost; but it can no longer overpower the consciousness of
            oneness. The terms <span class="tei tei-q">‘Son’</span> and
            <span class="tei tei-q">‘Father’</span> at once state the
            opposition and mark its limit. They show that it is not an
            absolute opposition, but one which presupposes an indestructible
            principle of unity, that can and must become a principle of
            reconciliation.”</span> The Evolution of Religion, ii. pp. 146,

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">The theistic explanation is by divine
          grace, which creates a new nature within one the moment the old
          nature is sincerely given up. The pantheistic explanation (which is
          that of most mind-curers) is by the merging of the narrower private
          self into the wider or greater self, the spirit of the universe
          (which is your own <span class="tei tei-q">“subconscious”</span>
          self), the moment the isolating barriers of mistrust and anxiety
          are removed. The medico-materialistic explanation is that simpler

          automatically by the shunting-out of physiologically (though in
          this instance not spiritually) <span class="tei tei-q">“higher”</span> ones which, seeking to regulate, only

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Within the
            churches a disposition has always prevailed to regard sickness as
            a visitation; something sent by God for our good, either as
            chastisement, as warning, or as opportunity for exercising
            virtue, and, in the Catholic Church, of earning <span class="tei tei-q">“merit.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Illness,”</span> says a good Catholic writer
            (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">P. Lejeune</span></span>: Introd. à la
            Vie Mystique, 1899, p. 218), <span class="tei tei-q">“is the most
            excellent of corporeal mortifications, the mortification which
            one has not one's self chosen, which is imposed directly by God,
            and is the direct expression of his will. <span class="tei tei-q">‘If other mortifications are of silver,’</span> Mgr.
            Gay says, <span class="tei tei-q">‘this one is of gold; since
            although it comes of ourselves, coming as it does of original
            sin, still on its greater side, as coming (like all that happens)
            from the providence of God, it is of divine manufacture. And how
            just are its blows! And how efficacious it is!... I do not
            hesitate to say that patience in a long illness is
            mortification's very masterpiece, and consequently the triumph of
            mortified souls.’</span> ”</span> According to this view, disease
            should in any case be submissively accepted, and it might under
            certain circumstances even be blasphemous to wish it away.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of course
            there have been exceptions to this, and cures by special miracle
            have at all times been recognized within the church's pale,
            almost all the great saints having more or less performed them.
            It was one of the heresies of Edward Irving, to maintain them
            still to be possible. An extremely pure faculty of healing after
            confession and conversion on the patient's part, and prayer on
            the priest's, was quite spontaneously developed in the German
            pastor, Joh. Christoph Blumhardt, in the early forties and
            exerted during nearly thirty years. Blumhardt's Life by Zündel
            (5th edition, Zurich, 1887) gives in chapters ix., x., xi., and
            xvii. a pretty full account of his healing activity, which he
            invariably ascribed to direct divine interposition. Blumhardt was
            a singularly pure, simple, and non-fanatical character, and in
            this part of his work followed no previous model. In Chicago
            to-day we have the case of Dr. J. A. Dowie, a Scottish Baptist
            preacher, whose weekly <span class="tei tei-q">“Leaves of
            Healing”</span> were in the year of grace 1900 in their sixth
            volume, and who, although he denounces the cures wrought in other
            sects as <span class="tei tei-q">“diabolical counterfeits”</span>
            of his own exclusively <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine
            Healing,”</span> must on the whole be counted into the mind-cure
            movement. In mind-cure circles the fundamental article of faith
            is that disease should never be accepted. It is wholly of the
            pit. God wants us to be absolutely healthy, and we should not
            tolerate ourselves on any lower terms.</p>

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">The God of many men is little more
          than their court of appeal against the damnatory judgment passed on
          their failures by the opinion of this world. To our own
          consciousness there is usually a residuum of worth left over after
          our sins and errors have been told off—our capacity of
          acknowledging and regretting them is the germ of a better self
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in posse</span></span> at least. But the world
          deals with us <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu</span></span> and not
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in posse</span></span>: and of this hidden
          germ, not to be guessed at from without, it never takes account.
          Then we turn to the All-knower, who knows our bad, but knows this
          good in us also, and who is just. We cast ourselves with our
          repentance on his mercy: only by an All-knower can we finally be
          judged. So the need of a God very definitely emerges from this sort
          of experience of life.</dd>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">E.g.,
            Theognis, 425-428: <span class="tei tei-q">“Best of all for all

            splendors of the Sun; next best to traverse as soon as possible
            the gates of Hades.”</span> See also the almost identical passage
            in Œdipus in Colonus, 1225.—The Anthology is full of pessimistic
            utterances: <span class="tei tei-q">“Naked came I upon the earth,
            naked I go below the ground—why then do I vainly toil when I see
            the end naked before me?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“How did

            life: once more shall I be what I was. Nothing and nothingness is

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The difference
            between Greek pessimism and the oriental and modern variety is
            that the Greeks had not made the discovery that the pathetic mood
            may be idealized, and figure as a higher form of sensibility.
            Their spirit was still too essentially masculine for pessimism to
            be elaborated or lengthily dwelt on in their classic literature.
            They would have despised a life set wholly in a minor key, and
            summoned it to keep within the proper bounds of lachrymosity. The
            discovery that the enduring emphasis, so far as this world goes,
            may be laid on its pain and failure, was reserved for races more
            complex, and (so to speak) more feminine than the Hellenes had
            attained to being in the classic period. But all the same was the
            outlook of those Hellenes blackly pessimistic.</p>

          contentment. Woman's heart and love are a shrewd device of Nature,
          a trap which she sets for the average man, to force him into

          was heard among the bushes; all of us were alarmed, and in an
          instant a tiger, rushing out of the jungle, pounced upon the one of
          the party that was foremost, and carried him off in the twinkling
          of an eye. The rush of the animal, and the crush of the poor

          by our enemy, the sovereign of the forest. I find my pen incapable
          of describing the terror of that dreadful moment. Our limbs
          stiffened, our power of speech ceased, and our hearts beat

            dating from a certain moment. The first is from Professor
            Starbuck's manuscript collection, and the narrator is a
            woman.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Away down in the bottom of my heart, I believe I was
            always more or less skeptical about <span class="tei tei-q">‘God;’</span> skepticism grew as an undercurrent, all
            through my early youth, but it was controlled and covered by the
            emotional elements in my religious growth. When I was sixteen I
            joined the church and was asked if I loved God. I replied
            <span class="tei tei-q">‘Yes,’</span> as was customary and
            expected. But instantly with a flash something spoke within me,
            <span class="tei tei-q">‘No, you do not.’</span> I was haunted
            for a long time with shame and remorse for my falsehood and for
            my wickedness in not loving God, mingled with fear that there
            might be an avenging God who would punish me in some terrible
            way.... At nineteen, I had an attack of tonsilitis. Before I had
            quite recovered, I heard told a story of a brute who had kicked
            his wife downstairs, and then continued the operation until she
            became insensible. I felt the horror of the thing keenly.
            Instantly this thought flashed through my mind: <span class="tei tei-q">‘I have no use for a God who permits such
            things.’</span> This experience was followed by months of stoical
            indifference to the God of my previous life, mingled with
            feelings of positive dislike and a somewhat proud defiance of
            him. I still thought there might be a God. If so he would
            probably damn me, but I should have to stand it. I felt very
            little fear and no desire to propitiate him. I have never had any
            personal relations with him since this painful
            experience.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
            case exemplifies how small an additional stimulus will overthrow
            the mind into a new state of equilibrium when the process of
            preparation and incubation has proceeded far enough. It is like
            the proverbial last straw added to the camel's burden, or that
            touch of a needle which makes the salt in a supersaturated fluid
            suddenly begin to crystallize out.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tolstoy
            writes: <span class="tei tei-q">“S., a frank and intelligent man,
            told me as follows how he ceased to believe:—</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He was twenty-six years old when one day on a
            hunting expedition, the time for sleep having come, he set
            himself to pray according to the custom he had held from
            childhood.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“His brother, who was hunting with him, lay upon the
            hay and looked at him. When S. had finished his prayer and was
            turning to sleep, the brother said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Do
            you still keep up that thing?’</span> Nothing more was said. But
            since that day, now more than thirty years ago, S. has never
            prayed again; he never takes communion, and does not go to
            church. All this, not because he became acquainted with
            convictions of his brother which he then and there adopted; not
            because he made any new resolution in his soul, but merely
            because the words spoken by his brother were like the light push
            of a finger against a leaning wall already about to tumble by its
            own weight. These words but showed him that the place wherein he
            supposed religion dwelt in him had long been empty, and that the
            sentences he uttered, the crosses and bows which he made during
            his prayer, were actions with no inner sense. Having once seized
            their absurdity, he could no longer keep them up.”</span> My

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I subjoin an
            additional document which has come into my possession, and which
            represents in a vivid way what is probably a very frequent sort
            of conversion, if the opposite of <span class="tei tei-q">“falling in love,”</span> falling out of love, may be
            so termed. Falling in love also conforms frequently to this type,
            a latent process of unconscious preparation often preceding a
            sudden awakening to the fact that the mischief is irretrievably
            done. The free and easy tone in this narrative gives it a
            sincerity that speaks for itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“For two years of this time I went through a very bad
            experience, which almost drove me mad. I had fallen violently in
            love with a girl who, young as she was, had a spirit of coquetry
            like a cat. As I look back on her now, I hate her, and wonder how
            I could ever have fallen so low as to be worked upon to such an
            extent by her attractions. Nevertheless, I fell into a regular
            fever, could think of nothing else; whenever I was alone, I
            pictured her attractions, and spent most of the time when I
            should have been working, in recalling our previous interviews,
            and imagining future conversations. She was very pretty, good
            humored, and jolly to the last degree, and intensely pleased with
            my admiration. Would give me no decided answer yes or no, and the
            queer thing about it was that whilst pursuing her for her hand, I
            secretly knew all along that she was unfit to be a wife for me,
            and that she never would say yes. Although for a year we took our
            meals at the same boarding-house, so that I saw her continually
            and familiarly, our closer relations had to be largely on the
            sly, and this fact, together with my jealousy of another one of
            her male admirers, and my own conscience despising me for my
            uncontrollable weakness, made me so nervous and sleepless that I
            really thought I should become insane. I understand well those
            young men murdering their sweethearts, which appear so often in
            the papers. Nevertheless I did love her passionately, and in some
            ways she did deserve it.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The queer thing was the sudden and unexpected way in
            which it all stopped. I was going to my work after breakfast one
            morning, thinking as usual of her and of my misery, when, just as
            if some outside power laid hold of me, I found myself turning
            round and almost running to my room, where I immediately got out
            all the relics of her which I possessed, including some hair, all
            her notes and letters, and ambrotypes on glass. The former I made
            a fire of, the latter I actually crushed beneath my heel, in a
            sort of fierce joy of revenge and punishment. I now loathed and
            despised her altogether, and as for myself I felt as if a load of
            disease had suddenly been removed from me. That was the end. I
            never spoke to her or wrote to her again in all the subsequent
            years, and I have never had a single moment of loving thought
            towards one who for so many months entirely filled my heart. In
            fact, I have always rather hated her memory, though now I can see
            that I had gone unnecessarily far in that direction. At any rate,
            from that happy morning onward I regained possession of my own
            proper soul, and have never since fallen into any similar
            trap.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This seems to
            me an unusually clear example of two different levels of
            personality, inconsistent in their dictates, yet so well balanced
            against each other as for a long time to fill the life with
            discord and dissatisfaction. At last, not gradually, but in a
            sudden crisis, the unstable equilibrium is resolved, and this
            happens so unexpectedly that it is as if, to use the writer's
            words, <span class="tei tei-q">“some outside power laid
            hold.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Professor
            Starbuck gives an analogous case, and a converse case of hatred
            suddenly turning into love, in his Psychology of Religion, p.
            141. Compare the other highly curious instances which he gives on
            pp. 137-144, of sudden non-religious alterations of habit or
            character. He seems right in conceiving all such sudden changes
            as results of special cerebral functions unconsciously developing
            until they are ready to play a controlling part, when they make
            irruption into the conscious life. When we treat of sudden
            <span class="tei tei-q">“conversion,”</span> I shall make as much
            use as I can of this hypothesis of subconscious incubation.</p>

          silence, by an involuntary elaboration of which I was not the

          Christian, yet, in the innocence of my intention, I should have

          the more commonplace sort must always be taken with the allowances
          which he suggests: <span class="tei tei-q">“A rule received and
          established by common consent has a very great, though to many
          persons an insensible influence in forming their notions of the
          process of their own experience. I know very well how they proceed
          as to this matter, for I have had frequent opportunities of
          observing their conduct. Very often their experience at first
          appears like a confused chaos, but then those parts are selected
          which bear the nearest resemblance to such particular steps as are
          insisted on; and these are dwelt upon in their thoughts, and spoken
          of from time to time, till they grow more and more conspicuous in
          their view, and other parts which are neglected grow more and more
          obscure. Thus what they have experienced is insensibly strained, so
          as to bring it to an exact conformity to the scheme already
          established in their minds. And it becomes natural also for
          ministers, who have to deal with those who insist upon distinctness
          and clearness of method, to do so too.”</span> Treatise on

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">For instance, C. G. Finney italicizes
          the volitional element: <span class="tei tei-q">“Just at this point
          the whole question of Gospel salvation opened to my mind in a
          manner most marvelous to me at the time. I think I then saw, as
          clearly as I ever have in my life, the reality and fullness of the
          atonement of Christ. Gospel salvation seemed to me to be an offer
          of something to be accepted, and all that was necessary on my part
          was to get my own consent to give up my sins and accept Christ.
          After this distinct revelation had stood for some little time
          before my mind, the question seemed to be put, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Will you accept it now, to-day?’</span> I replied,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Yes; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I will accept it to-day, or I will die in the
          attempt!</span></em>’</span> ”</span> He then went into the woods,
          where he describes his struggles. He could not pray, his heart was
          hardened in its pride. <span class="tei tei-q">“I then reproached
          myself for having promised to give my heart to God before I left
          the woods. When I came to try, I found I could not.... My inward
          soul hung back, and there was no going out of my heart to God. The
          thought was pressing me, of the rashness of my promise that I would
          give my heart to God that day, or die in the attempt. It seemed to
          me as if that was binding on my soul; and yet I was going to break
          my vow. A great sinking and discouragement came over me, and I felt
          almost too weak to stand upon my knees. Just at this moment I again
          thought I heard some one approach me, and I opened my eyes to see
          whether it were so. But right there the revelation of my pride of
          heart, as the great difficulty that stood in the way, was
          distinctly shown to me. An overwhelming sense of my wickedness in
          being ashamed to have a human being see me on my knees before God
          took such powerful possession of me, that I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cried at the top of
          my voice, and exclaimed that I would not leave that place if all
          the men on earth and all the devils in hell surrounded
          me</span></em>. <span class="tei tei-q">‘What!’</span> I said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘such a degraded sinner as I am, on my

          endeavoring to make my peace with my offended God!’</span> The sin

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">Describing the whole phenomenon as a
          change of equilibrium, we might say that the movement of new

          old ones towards the margin (or the rising of some objects above,
          and the sinking of others below the conscious threshold) were only
          two ways of describing an indivisible event. Doubtless this is

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">The reader will here please notice
          that in my exclusive reliance in the last lecture on the
          subconscious <span class="tei tei-q">“incubation”</span> of motives
          deposited by a growing experience, I followed the method of
          employing accepted principles of explanation as far as one can. The
          subliminal region, whatever else it may be, is at any rate a place
          now admitted by psychologists to exist for the accumulation of
          vestiges of sensible experience (whether inattentively or
          attentively registered), and for their elaboration according to
          ordinary psychological or logical laws into results that end by
          attaining such a <span class="tei tei-q">“tension”</span> that they
          may at times enter consciousness with something like a burst. It
          thus is <span class="tei tei-q">“scientific”</span> to interpret
          all otherwise unaccountable invasive alterations of consciousness
          as results of the tension of subliminal memories reaching the
          bursting-point. But candor obliges me to confess that there are
          occasional bursts into consciousness of results of which it is not
          easy to demonstrate any prolonged subconscious incubation. Some of
          the cases I used to illustrate the sense of presence of the unseen
          in Lecture <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Lecture_III">III</a> were
          of this order (compare pages <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Pg059">59</a>, <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Pg061">61</a>,
          <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Pg062">62</a>, <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Pg067">67</a>); and we shall see other experiences of
          the kind when we come to the subject of mysticism. The case of Mr.
          Bradley, that of M. Ratisbonne, possibly that of Colonel Gardiner,
          possibly that of Saint Paul, might not be so easily explained in
          this simple way. The result, then, would have to be ascribed either
          to a merely physiological nerve storm, a <span class="tei tei-q">“discharging lesion”</span> like that of epilepsy; or,
          in case it were useful and rational, as in the two latter cases
          named, to some more mystical or theological hypothesis. I make this
          remark in order that the reader may realize that the subject is
          really complex. But I shall keep myself as far as possible at
          present to the more <span class="tei tei-q">“scientific”</span>
          view; and only as the plot thickens in subsequent lectures shall I
          consider the question of its absolute sufficiency as an explanation
          of all the facts. That subconscious incubation explains a great
          number of them, there can be no doubt.</dd>

            of sensorial photism shade off into what are evidently only

            all about it, intending then to get up and go on. Such a thing as
            any special answer to my prayer never entered my mind, having
            been converted by faith, but still being most undoubtedly saved.
            Well, while I was praying, I remember holding out my hands to God
            and telling him they should work for him, my feet walk for him,
            my tongue speak for him, etc., etc., if he would only use me as
            his instrument and give me a satisfying experience—when suddenly
            the darkness of the night seemed lit up—I felt, realized, knew,
            that God heard and answered my prayer. Deep happiness came over
            me; I felt I was accepted into the inner circle of God's loved
            ones.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A prayer meeting had been called for at close of
            evening service. The minister supposed me impressed by his
            discourse (a mistake—he was dull). He came and, placing his hand
            upon my shoulder, said: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Do you not want
            to give your heart to God?’</span> I replied in the affirmative.
            Then said he, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Come to the front
            seat.’</span> They sang and prayed and talked with me. I
            experienced nothing but unaccountable wretchedness. They declared
            that the reason why I did not <span class="tei tei-q">‘obtain
            peace’</span> was because I was not willing to give up all to
            God. After about two hours the minister said we would go home. As
            usual, on retiring, I prayed. In great distress, I at this time
            simply said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Lord, I have done all I
            can, I leave the whole matter with thee.’</span> Immediately,
            like a flash of light, there came to me a great peace, and I
            arose and went into my parents' bedroom and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I do feel so wonderfully happy.’</span> This I
            regard as the hour of conversion. It was the hour in which I
            became assured of divine acceptance and favor. So far as my life
            was concerned, it made little immediate change.”</span></p>

          man, a different life. Various excitements let the courage loose.
          Trustful hope will do it; inspiring example will do it; love will
          do it; wrath will do it. In some people it is natively so high that

          with an exaggerated rapture. The fewer there are to share it, the
          more I like it. The participation of my body in the event is
          required to furnish me an adequate excitement. Everything
          intellectual appears to me to be reflex; but a meeting of man to
          man, a duel, a danger into which I can throw myself headforemost,
          attracts me, moves me, intoxicates me. I am crazy for it, I love
          it, I adore it. I run after danger as one runs after women; I wish
          it never to stop. Were it always the same, it would always bring me
          a new pleasure. When I throw myself into an adventure in which I
          hope to find it, my heart palpitates with the uncertainty; I could
          wish at once to have it appear and yet to delay. A sort of painful

            smoking, a voice came to me. I did not hear it with my ears, but

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Professor
            Starbuck expresses the radical destruction of old influences
            physiologically, as a cutting off of the connection between
            higher and lower cerebral centres. <span class="tei tei-q">“This
            condition,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“in which the
            association-centres connected with the spiritual life are cut off
            from the lower, is often reflected in the way correspondents
            describe their experiences.... For example: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Temptations from without still assail me, but there
            is nothing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">within</span></em> to respond to
            them.’</span> The ego [here] is wholly identified with the higher
            centres, whose quality of feeling is that of withinness. Another
            of the respondents says: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Since then,
            although Satan tempts me, there is as it were a wall of brass
            around me, so that his darts cannot touch
            me.’</span> ”</span>—Unquestionably, functional exclusions of
            this sort must occur in the cerebral organ. But on the side
            accessible to introspection, their causal condition is nothing
            but the degree of spiritual excitement, getting at last so high
            and strong as to be sovereign; and it must be frankly confessed
            that we do not know just why or how such sovereignty comes about
            in one person and not in another. We can only give our
            imagination a certain delusive help by mechanical analogies.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we should
            conceive, for example, that the human mind, with its different
            possibilities of equilibrium, might be like a many-sided solid
            with different surfaces on which it could lie flat, we might
            liken mental revolutions to the spatial revolutions of such a
            body. As it is pried up, say by a lever, from a position in which
            it lies on surface A, for instance, it will linger for a time
            unstably halfway up, and if the lever cease to urge it, it will
            tumble back or <span class="tei tei-q">“relapse”</span> under the
            continued pull of gravity. But if at last it rotate far enough
            for its centre of gravity to pass beyond surface A altogether,
            the body will fall over, on surface B, say, and abide there
            permanently. The pulls of gravity towards A have vanished, and
            may now be disregarded. The polyhedron has become immune against
            farther attraction from their direction.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this figure
            of speech the lever may correspond to the emotional influences
            making for a new life, and the initial pull of gravity to the
            ancient drawbacks and inhibitions. So long as the emotional
            influence fails to reach a certain pitch of efficacy, the changes
            it produces are unstable, and the man relapses into his original
            attitude. But when a certain intensity is attained by the new
            emotion, a critical point is passed, and there then ensues an
            irreversible revolution, equivalent to the production of a new
            nature.</p>

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">Compare Madame Guyon: <span class="tei tei-q">“It was my practice to arise at midnight for purposes
          of devotion.... It seemed to me that God came at the precise time
          and woke me from sleep in order that I might enjoy him. When I was
          out of health or greatly fatigued, he did not awake me, but at such
          times I felt, even in my sleep, a singular possession of God. He
          loved me so much that he seemed to pervade my being, at a time when
          I could be only imperfectly conscious of his presence. My sleep is
          sometimes broken,—a sort of half sleep; but my soul seems to be
          awake enough to know God, when it is hardly capable of knowing
          anything else.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">T. C. Upham</span></span>: The Life and

          also. We read of Towianski, an eminent Polish patriot and mystic,

          the rain, caressing a big dog which was jumping upon him and
          covering him horribly with mud. On being asked why he permitted the

          has shown a great fellow-feeling for me, and a great joy in my
          recognition and acceptance of his greetings. Were I to drive him
          off, I should wound his feelings and do him a moral injury. It
          would be an offense not only to him, but to all the spirits of the
          other world who are on the same level with him. The damage which he
          does to my coat is as nothing in comparison with the wrong which I
          should inflict upon him, in case I were to remain indifferent to
          the manifestations of his friendship. We ought,’</span> he added,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“At a meeting held at six the next morning, I heard a
            man relate his experience. He said: The Lord asked him if he
            would confess Christ among the quarrymen with whom he worked, and
            he said he would. Then he asked him if he would give up to be
            used of the Lord the four hundred dollars he had laid up, and he
            said he would, and thus the Lord saved him. The thought came to
            me at once that I had never made a real consecration either of
            myself or of my property to the Lord, but had always tried to
            serve the Lord in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">my</span></em> way. Now the Lord asked me if
            I would serve him in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em> way, and go out alone and
            penniless if he so ordered. The question was pressed home, and I
            must decide: To forsake all and have him, or have all and lose
            him! I soon decided to take him; and the blessed assurance came,
            that he had taken me for his own, and my joy was full. I returned
            home from the meeting with feelings as simple as a child. I
            thought all would be glad to hear of the joy of the Lord that
            possessed me, and so I began to tell the simple story. But to my
            great surprise, the pastors (for I attended meetings in three
            churches) opposed the experience and said it was fanaticism, and
            one told the members of his church to shun those that professed
            it, and I soon found that my foes were those of my own
            household.”</span></p>

          Anthony of Padua to Christ's childhood; Saint Bernard to his
          humanity; Saint Teresa to Saint Joseph, etc. The Shi-ite
          Mohammedans venerate Ali, the Prophet's son-in-law, instead of

          signify to the world that he was the most devoted partisan of that
          Ali who had been dead a thousand years. In his own home, speaking
          with his wife, children, and friends, no other word but
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ali!’</span> ever passed his lips. If he

          harp on his monotonous <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ali!’</span>
          Latterly his zeal assumed such tremendous proportions that, like a
          madman, he would race, the whole day, up and down the streets of
          the town, throwing his stick high up into the air, and shriek out,

            for the glory of God, to relieve herself by holding certain
            odoriferous substances in her mouth, when the Lord appeared to
            her to lean over towards her lovingly, and to find comfort
            Himself in these odors. After having gently breathed them in, He
            arose, and said with a gratified air to the Saints, as if
            contented with what He had done: <span class="tei tei-q">‘See the
            new present which my betrothed has given Me!’</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“One day, at chapel, she heard supernaturally sung
            the words, <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sanctus, Sanctus,
            Sanctus</span></span>.’</span> The Son of God leaning towards her
            like a sweet lover, and giving to her soul the softest kiss, said
            to her at the second Sanctus: <span class="tei tei-q">‘In this

            behold the Son of God, more beauteous than thousands of angels,
            takes her in His arms as if He were proud of her, and presents
            her to God the Father, in that perfection of sanctity with which

          that this formal condition was peculiarly characteristic of
          religion, and that one might in comparison almost neglect material
          content, in studying the latter. I trust that the present work will
          convince the reader that religion has plenty of material content
          which is characteristic, and which is more important by far than
          any general psychological form. In spite of this criticism, I find

          the first beginning of the Servitor's [Suso's] interior life, after
          he had purified his soul properly by confession, he marked out for
          himself, in thought, three circles, within which he shut himself
          up, as in a spiritual intrenchment. The first circle was his cell,
          his chapel, and the choir. When he was within this circle, he
          seemed to himself in complete security. The second circle was the
          whole monastery as far as the outer gate. The third and outermost
          circle was the gate itself, and here it was necessary for him to
          stand well upon his guard. When he went outside these circles, it
          seemed to him that he was in the plight of some wild animal which

            resist the temptation to quote from Starbuck's book, p. 388,
            another case of purification by elimination. It runs as
            follows:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The signs of abnormality which sanctified persons
            show are of frequent occurrence. They get out of tune with other
            people; often they will have nothing to do with churches, which
            they regard as worldly; they become hypercritical towards others;
            they grow careless of their social, political, and financial
            obligations. As an instance of this type may be mentioned a woman
            of sixty-eight of whom the writer made a special study. She had
            been a member of one of the most active and progressive churches
            in a busy part of a large city. Her pastor described her as
            having reached the censorious stage. She had grown more and more
            out of sympathy with the church; her connection with it finally
            consisted simply in attendance at prayer-meeting, at which her
            only message was that of reproof and condemnation of the others
            for living on a low plane. At last she withdrew from fellowship
            with any church. The writer found her living alone in a little
            room on the top story of a cheap boarding-house, quite out of
            touch with all human relations, but apparently happy in the
            enjoyment of her own spiritual blessings. Her time was occupied
            in writing booklets on sanctification—page after page of dreamy
            rhapsody. She proved to be one of a small group of persons who
            claim that entire salvation involves three steps instead of two;
            not only must there be conversion and sanctification, but a
            third, which they call <span class="tei tei-q">‘crucifixion’</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">‘perfect redemption,’</span> and which seems to bear
            the same relation to sanctification that this bears to
            conversion. She related how the Spirit had said to her,
            <span class="tei tei-q">‘Stop going to church. Stop going to
            holiness meetings. Go to your own room and I will teach
            you.’</span> She professes to care nothing for colleges, or
            preachers, or churches, but only cares to listen to what God says
            to her. Her description of her experience seemed entirely
            consistent; she is happy and contented, and her life is entirely
            satisfactory to herself. While listening to her own story, one
            was tempted to forget that it was from the life of a person who
            could not live by it in conjunction with her fellows.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The best
            missionary lives abound in the victorious combination of
            non-resistance with personal authority. John G. Paton, for
            example, in the New Hebrides, among brutish Melanesian cannibals,
            preserves a charmed life by dint of it. When it comes to the
            point, no one ever dares actually to strike him. Native converts,
            inspired by him, showed analogous virtue. <span class="tei tei-q">“One of our chiefs, full of the Christ-kindled desire
            to seek and to save, sent a message to an inland chief, that he
            and four attendants would come on Sabbath and tell them the
            gospel of Jehovah God. The reply came back sternly forbidding
            their visit, and threatening with death any Christian that
            approached their village. Our chief sent in response a loving
            message, telling them that Jehovah had taught the Christians to
            return good for evil, and that they would come unarmed to tell
            them the story of how the Son of God came into the world and died
            in order to bless and save his enemies. The heathen chief sent
            back a stern and prompt reply once more: <span class="tei tei-q">‘If you come, you will be killed.’</span> On Sabbath
            morn the Christian chief and his four companions were met outside
            the village by the heathen chief, who implored and threatened
            them once more. But the former said:—</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘We come to you without
            weapons of war! We come only to tell you about Jesus. We believe
            that He will protect us to-day.’</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“As they pressed steadily forward towards the
            village, spears began to be thrown at them. Some they evaded,
            being all except one dexterous warriors; and others they
            literally received with their bare hands, and turned them aside
            in an incredible manner. The heathen, apparently thunderstruck at
            these men thus approaching them without weapons of war, and not
            even flinging back their own spears which they had caught, after
            having thrown what the old chief called <span class="tei tei-q">‘a shower of spears,’</span> desisted from mere
            surprise. Our Christian chief called out, as he and his
            companions drew up in the midst of them on the village public
            ground:—</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Jehovah thus protects us.
            He has given us all your spears! Once we would have thrown them
            back at you and killed you. But now we come, not to fight but to
            tell you about Jesus. He has changed our dark hearts. He asks you
            now to lay down all these your other weapons of war, and to hear
            what we can tell you about the love of God, our great Father, the
            only living God.’</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The heathen were perfectly overawed. They manifestly
            looked on these Christians as protected by some Invisible One.
            They listened for the first time to the story of the Gospel and
            of the Cross. We lived to see that chief and all his tribe
            sitting in the school of Christ. And there is perhaps not an
            island in these southern seas, amongst all those won for Christ,
            where similar acts of heroism on the part of converts cannot be

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">Saint Peter, Saint Teresa tells us in
          her autobiography (French translation, p. 333), <span class="tei tei-q">“had passed forty years without ever sleeping more than
          an hour and a half a day. Of all his mortifications, this was the
          one that had cost him the most. To compass it, he kept always on
          his knees or on his feet. The little sleep he allowed nature to
          take was snatched in a sitting posture, his head leaning against a
          piece of wood fixed in the wall. Even had he wished to lie down, it
          would have been impossible, because his cell was only four feet and
          a half long. In the course of all these years he never raised his
          hood, no matter what the ardor of the sun or the rain's strength.
          He never put on a shoe. He wore a garment of coarse sackcloth, with
          nothing else upon his skin. This garment was as scant as possible,
          and over it a little cloak of the same stuff. When the cold was
          great he took off the cloak and opened for a while the door and
          little window of his cell. Then he closed them and resumed the
          mantle,—his way, as he told us, of warming himself, and making his
          body feel a better temperature. It was a frequent thing with him to
          eat once only in three days; and when I expressed my surprise, he
          said that it was very easy if one once had acquired the habit. One
          of his companions has assured me that he has gone sometimes eight
          days without food.... His poverty was extreme; and his
          mortification, even in his youth, was such that he told me he had
          passed three years in a house of his order without knowing any of
          the monks otherwise than by the sound of their voice, for he never
          raised his eyes, and only found his way about by following the
          others. He showed this same modesty on public highways. He spent
          many years without ever laying eyes upon a woman; but he confessed
          to me that at the age he had reached it was indifferent to him
          whether he laid eyes on them or not. He was very old when I first
          came to know him, and his body so attenuated that it seemed formed
          of nothing so much as of so many roots of trees. With all this
          sanctity he was very affable. He never spoke unless he was
          questioned, but his intellectual right-mindedness and grace gave to
          all his words an irresistible charm.”</span></dd>

            Voices. In a letter to Mr. B. P. Blood, Tennyson reports of
            himself as follows:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I have never had any revelations through
            anæsthetics, but a kind of waking trance—this for lack of a
            better word—I have frequently had, quite up from boyhood, when I
            have been all alone. This has come upon me through repeating my
            own name to myself silently, till all at once, as it were out of
            the intensity of the consciousness of individuality,
            individuality itself seemed to dissolve and fade away into
            boundless being, and this not a confused state but the clearest,
            the surest of the surest, utterly beyond words—where death was an
            almost laughable impossibility—the loss of personality (if so it
            were) seeming no extinction, but the only true life. I am ashamed
            of my feeble description. Have I not said the state is utterly
            beyond words?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Professor
            Tyndall, in a letter, recalls Tennyson saying of this condition:

            transcendent wonder, associated with absolute clearness of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Benjamin Paul
            Blood</span></span>: The Anæsthetic Revelation and the Gist of
            Philosophy, Amsterdam, N. Y., 1874, pp. 35, 36. Mr. Blood has
            made several attempts to adumbrate the anæsthetic revelation, in
            pamphlets of rare literary distinction, privately printed and
            distributed by himself at Amsterdam. Xenos Clark, a philosopher,
            who died young at Amherst in the '80's, much lamented by those
            who knew him, was also impressed by the revelation. <span class="tei tei-q">“In the first place,”</span> he once wrote to me,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Blood and I agree that the
            revelation is, if anything, non-emotional. It is utterly flat. It
            is, as Mr. Blood says, <span class="tei tei-q">‘the one sole and
            sufficient insight why, or not why, but how, the present is
            pushed on by the past, and sucked forward by the vacuity of the
            future. Its inevitableness defeats all attempts at stopping or
            accounting for it. It is all precedence and presupposition, and
            questioning is in regard to it forever too late. It is an
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">initiation of the past</span></em>.’</span>
            The real secret would be the formula by which the <span class="tei tei-q">‘now’</span> keeps exfoliating out of itself, yet
            never escapes. What is it, indeed, that keeps existence
            exfoliating? The formal being of anything, the logical definition
            of it, is static. For mere logic every question contains its own
            answer—we simply fill the hole with the dirt we dug out. Why are
            twice two four? Because, in fact, four is twice two. Thus logic
            finds in life no propulsion, only a momentum. It goes because it
            is a-going. But the revelation adds: it goes because it is and
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></em> a-going. You walk, as it
            were, round yourself in the revelation. Ordinary philosophy is
            like a hound hunting his own trail. The more he hunts the farther
            he has to go, and his nose never catches up with his heels,
            because it is forever ahead of them. So the present is already a
            foregone conclusion, and I am ever too late to understand it. But
            at the moment of recovery from anæsthesis, just then, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before starting
            on life</span></em>, I catch, so to speak, a glimpse of my heels,
            a glimpse of the eternal process just in the act of starting. The
            truth is that we travel on a journey that was accomplished before
            we set out; and the real end of philosophy is accomplished, not
            when we arrive at, but when we remain in, our destination (being
            already there),—which may occur vicariously in this life when we
            cease our intellectual questioning. That is why there is a smile
            upon the face of the revelation, as we view it. It tells us that
            we are forever half a second too late—that's all. <span class="tei tei-q">‘You could kiss your own lips, and have all the fun
            to yourself,’</span> it says, if you only knew the trick. It
            would be perfectly easy if they would just stay there till you
            got round to them. Why don't you manage it somehow?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dialectically
            minded readers of this farrago will at least recognize the region
            of thought of which Mr. Clark writes, as familiar. In his latest
            pamphlet, <span class="tei tei-q">“Tennyson's Trances and the
            Anæsthetic Revelation,”</span> Mr. Blood describes its value for
            life as follows:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The Anæsthetic Revelation is the Initiation of Man
            into the Immemorial Mystery of the Open Secret of Being, revealed
            as the Inevitable Vortex of Continuity. Inevitable is the word.
            Its motive is inherent—it is what has to be. It is not for any
            love or hate, nor for joy nor sorrow, nor good nor ill. End,
            beginning, or purpose, it knows not of.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It affords no particular of the multiplicity and
            variety of things; but it fills appreciation of the historical
            and the sacred with a secular and intimately personal
            illumination of the nature and motive of existence, which then
            seems reminiscent—as if it should have appeared, or shall yet
            appear, to every participant thereof.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Although it is at first startling in its solemnity,
            it becomes directly such a matter of course—so old-fashioned, and
            so akin to proverbs, that it inspires exultation rather than
            fear, and a sense of safety, as identified with the aboriginal
            and the universal. But no words may express the imposing
            certainty of the patient that he is realizing the primordial,
            Adamic surprise of Life.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Repetition of the experience finds it ever the same,
            and as if it could not possibly be otherwise. The subject resumes
            his normal consciousness only to partially and fitfully remember
            its occurrence, and to try to formulate its baffling import,—with
            only this consolatory afterthought: that he has known the oldest
            truth, and that he has done with human theories as to the origin,
            meaning, or destiny of the race. He is beyond instruction in
            <span class="tei tei-q">‘spiritual things.’</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The lesson is one of central safety: the Kingdom is
            within. All days are judgment days: but there can be no
            climacteric purpose of eternity, nor any scheme of the whole. The
            astronomer abridges the row of bewildering figures by increasing
            his unit of measurement: so may we reduce the distracting
            multiplicity of things to the unity for which each of us
            stands.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This has been my moral sustenance since I have known
            of it. In my first printed mention of it I declared: <span class="tei tei-q">‘The world is no more the alien terror that was
            taught me. Spurning the cloud-grimed and still sultry battlements
            whence so lately Jehovan thunders boomed, my gray gull lifts her
            wing against the nightfall, and takes the dim leagues with a
            fearless eye.’</span> And now, after twenty-seven years of this
            experience, the wing is grayer, but the eye is fearless still,
            while I renew and doubly emphasize that declaration. I know—as
            having known—the meaning of Existence: the sane centre of the
            universe—at once the wonder and the assurance of the soul—for
            which the speech of reason has as yet no name but the Anæsthetic
            Revelation.”</span>—I have considerably abridged the
            quotation.</p>

            interesting anæsthetic revelation communicated to me in
            manuscript by a friend in England. The subject, a gifted woman,
            was taking ether for a surgical operation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wondered if I was in a prison being tortured, and
            why I remembered having heard it said that people <span class="tei tei-q">‘learn through suffering,’</span> and in view of what
            I was seeing, the inadequacy of this saying struck me so much
            that I said, aloud, <span class="tei tei-q">‘to suffer <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> to
            learn.’</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“With that I became unconscious again, and my last
            dream immediately preceded my real coming to. It only lasted a
            few seconds, and was most vivid and real to me, though it may not
            be clear in words.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A great Being or Power was traveling through the
            sky, his foot was on a kind of lightning as a wheel is on a rail,
            it was his pathway. The lightning was made entirely of the
            spirits of innumerable people close to one another, and I was one
            of them. He moved in a straight line, and each part of the streak
            or flash came into its short conscious existence only that he
            might travel. I seemed to be directly under the foot of God, and
            I thought he was grinding his own life up out of my pain. Then I
            saw that what he had been trying with all his might to do was to
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">change
            his course</span></em>, to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bend</span></em> the line of lightning to
            which he was tied, in the direction in which he wanted to go. I
            felt my flexibility and helplessness, and knew that he would
            succeed. He bended me, turning his corner by means of my hurt,
            hurting me more than I had ever been hurt in my life, and at the
            acutest point of this, as he passed, I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">saw</span></em>.
            I understood for a moment things that I have now forgotten,
            things that no one could remember while retaining sanity. The
            angle was an obtuse angle, and I remember thinking as I woke that
            had he made it a right or acute angle, I should have both
            suffered and <span class="tei tei-q">‘seen’</span> still more,
            and should probably have died.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He went on and I came to. In that moment the whole
            of my life passed before me, including each little meaningless
            piece of distress, and I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">understood</span></em> them. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">This</span></em>
            was what it had all meant, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> was the piece of work it
            had all been contributing to do. I did not see God's purpose, I
            only saw his intentness and his entire relentlessness towards his
            means. He thought no more of me than a man thinks of hurting a
            cork when he is opening wine, or hurting a cartridge when he is
            firing. And yet, on waking, my first feeling was, and it came
            with tears, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Domine non sum
            digna,’</span> for I had been lifted into a position for which I
            was too small. I realized that in that half hour under ether I
            had served God more distinctly and purely than I had ever done in
            my life before, or that I am capable of desiring to do. I was the
            means of his achieving and revealing something, I know not what
            or to whom, and that, to the exact extent of my capacity for
            suffering.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“While regaining consciousness, I wondered why, since
            I had gone so deep, I had seen nothing of what the saints call
            the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">love</span></em> of God, nothing but his
            relentlessness. And then I heard an answer, which I could only
            just catch, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Knowledge and Love
            are One, and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">measure</span></em> is suffering’</span>—I
            give the words as they came to me. With that I came finally to
            (into what seemed a dream world compared with the reality of what
            I was leaving), and I saw that what would be called the
            <span class="tei tei-q">‘cause’</span> of my experience was a
            slight operation under insufficient ether, in a bed pushed up
            against a window, a common city window in a common city street.
            If I had to formulate a few of the things I then caught a glimpse
            of, they would run somewhat as follows:—</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The eternal necessity of suffering and its eternal
            vicariousness. The veiled and incommunicable nature of the worst
            sufferings;—the passivity of genius, how it is essentially
            instrumental and defenseless, moved, not moving, it must do what
            it does;—the impossibility of discovery without its
            price;—finally, the excess of what the suffering <span class="tei tei-q">‘seer’</span> or genius pays over what his generation
            gains. (He seems like one who sweats his life out to earn enough
            to save a district from famine, and just as he staggers back,
            dying and satisfied, bringing a lac of rupees to buy grain with,
            God lifts the lac away, dropping <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
            rupee, and says, <span class="tei tei-q">‘That you may give them.
            That you have earned for them. The rest is for ME.’</span>) I
            perceived also in a way never to be forgotten, the excess of what
            we see over what we can demonstrate.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And so on!—these things may seem to you delusions,
            or truisms; but for me they are dark truths, and the power to put
            them into even such words as these has been given me by an ether
            dream.”</span></p>

            may then swallow up the smaller one. I take this from Starbuck's
            manuscript collection:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I never lost the consciousness of the presence of
            God until I stood at the foot of the Horseshoe Falls, Niagara.
            Then I lost him in the immensity of what I saw. I also lost
            myself, feeling that I was an atom too small for the notice of
            Almighty God.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I subjoin
            another similar case from Starbuck's collection:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In that time the consciousness of God's nearness
            came to me sometimes. I say God, to describe what is
            indescribable. A presence, I might say, yet that is too
            suggestive of personality, and the moments of which I speak did
            not hold the consciousness of a personality, but something in
            myself made me feel myself a part of something bigger than I,
            that was controlling. I felt myself one with the grass, the
            trees, birds, insects, everything in Nature. I exulted in the
            mere fact of existence, of being a part of it all—the drizzling
            rain, the shadows of the clouds, the tree-trunks, and so on. In
            the years following, such moments continued to come, but I wanted
            them constantly. I knew so well the satisfaction of losing self
            in a perception of supreme power and love, that I was unhappy
            because that perception was not constant.”</span> The cases
            quoted in my third lecture, pp. <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Pg066">66</a>, <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Pg067">67</a>, <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Pg070">70</a>, are still better ones of this type. In her
            essay, The Loss of Personality, in The Atlantic Monthly (vol.
            lxxxv. p. 195), Miss Ethel D. Puffer explains that the vanishing
            of the sense of self, and the feeling of immediate unity with the
            object, is due to the disappearance, in these rapturous
            experiences, of the motor adjustments which habitually
            intermediate between the constant background of consciousness
            (which is the Self) and the object in the foreground, whatever it
            may be. I must refer the reader to the highly instructive
            article, which seems to me to throw light upon the psychological
            conditions, though it fails to account for the rapture or the
            revelation-value of the experience in the Subject's eyes.</p>

          deserving the name), an intuition of the absolute balance, in time
          and space, of the whole of this multifariousness, this revel of

          <span class="tei tei-q">“In one quarter of an hour I saw and knew
          more than if I had been many years together at an university. For I
          saw and knew the being of all things, the Byss and the Abyss, and
          the eternal generation of the holy Trinity, the descent and
          original of the world and of all creatures through the divine
          wisdom. I knew and saw in myself all the three worlds, the external
          and visible world being of a procreation or extern birth from both
          the internal and spiritual worlds; and I saw and knew the whole
          working essence, in the evil and in the good, and the mutual
          original and existence; and likewise how the fruitful bearing womb
          of eternity brought forth. So that I did not only greatly wonder at
          it, but did also exceedingly rejoice, albeit I could very hardly
          apprehend the same in my external man and set it down with the pen.
          For I had a thorough view of the universe as in a chaos, wherein
          all things are couched and wrapt up, but it was impossible for me
          to explicate the same.”</span> Jacob Behmen's Theosophic

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From a French
            book I take this mystical expression of happiness in God's
            indwelling presence:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus has come to take up his abode in my heart. It
            is not so much a habitation, an association, as a sort of fusion.
            Oh, new and blessed life! life which becomes each day more
            luminous.... The wall before me, dark a few moments since, is
            splendid at this hour because the sun shines on it. Wherever its
            rays fall they light up a conflagration of glory; the smallest
            speck of glass sparkles, each grain of sand emits fire; even so
            there is a royal song of triumph in my heart because the Lord is
            there. My days succeed each other; yesterday a blue sky; to-day a
            clouded sun; a night filled with strange dreams; but as soon as
            the eyes open, and I regain consciousness and seem to begin life
            again, it is always the same figure before me, always the same
            presence filling my heart.... Formerly the day was dulled by the
            absence of the Lord. I used to wake invaded by all sorts of sad
            impressions, and I did not find him on my path. To-day he is with
            me; and the light cloudiness which covers things is not an
            obstacle to my communion with him. I feel the pressure of his
            hand, I feel something else which fills me with a serene joy;
            shall I dare to speak it out? Yes, for it is the true expression
            of what I experience. The Holy Spirit is not merely making me a
            visit; it is no mere dazzling apparition which may from one
            moment to another spread its wings and leave me in my night, it
            is a permanent habitation. He can depart only if he takes me with
            him. More than that; he is not other than myself: he is one with
            me. It is not a juxtaposition, it is a penetration, a profound
            modification of my nature, a new manner of my being.”</span>

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">In chapter i. of book ii. of his work
          Degeneration, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Max
          Nordau</span></span>”</span> seeks to undermine all mysticism by
          exposing the weakness of the lower kinds. Mysticism for him means
          any sudden perception of hidden significance in things. He explains
          such perception by the abundant uncompleted associations which
          experiences may arouse in a degenerate brain. These give to him who
          has the experience a vague and vast sense of its leading further,
          yet they awaken no definite or useful consequent in his thought.
          The explanation is a plausible one for certain sorts of feeling of
          significance; and other alienists (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Wernicke</span></span>, for example, in
          his Grundriss der Psychiatrie, Theil ii., Leipzig, 1896) have

          a laming of the association-organ. But the higher mystical flights,
          with their positiveness and abruptness, are surely products of no
          such merely negative condition. It seems far more reasonable to
          ascribe them to inroads from the subconscious life, of the cerebral

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must not be
            forgotten that any form of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dis</span></em>order in the world might, by
            the design argument, suggest a God for just that kind of
            disorder. The truth is that any state of things whatever that can
            be named is logically susceptible of teleological interpretation.
            The ruins of the earthquake at Lisbon, for example: the whole of
            past history had to be planned exactly as it was to bring about
            in the fullness of time just that particular arrangement of
            débris of masonry, furniture, and once living bodies. No other
            train of causes would have been sufficient. And so of any other
            arrangement, bad or good, which might as a matter of fact be
            found resulting anywhere from previous conditions. To avoid such
            pessimistic consequences and save its beneficent designer, the
            design argument accordingly invokes two other principles,
            restrictive in their operation. The first is physical: Nature's
            forces tend of their own accord only to disorder and destruction,
            to heaps of ruins, not to architecture. This principle, though
            plausible at first sight, seems, in the light of recent biology,
            to be more and more improbable. The second principle is one of
            anthropomorphic interpretation. No arrangement that for
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">us</span></em> is <span class="tei tei-q">“disorderly”</span> can possibly have been an object
            of design at all. This principle is of course a mere assumption
            in the interests of anthropomorphic Theism.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When one views
            the world with no definite theological bias one way or the other,
            one sees that order and disorder, as we now recognize them, are
            purely human inventions. We are interested in certain types of
            arrangement, useful, æsthetic, or moral,—so interested that
            whenever we find them realized, the fact emphatically rivets our
            attention. The result is that we work over the contents of the
            world selectively. It is overflowing with disorderly arrangements
            from our point of view, but order is the only thing we care for
            and look at, and by choosing, one can always find some sort of
            orderly arrangement in the midst of any chaos. If I should throw
            down a thousand beans at random upon a table, I could doubtless,
            by eliminating a sufficient number of them, leave the rest in
            almost any geometrical pattern you might propose to me, and you
            might then say that that pattern was the thing prefigured
            beforehand, and that the other beans were mere irrelevance and
            packing material. Our dealings with Nature are just like this.
            She is a vast <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">plenum</span></span> in which our attention
            draws capricious lines in innumerable directions. We count and
            name whatever lies upon the special lines we trace, whilst the
            other things and the untraced lines are neither named nor
            counted. There are in reality infinitely more things 'unadapted'
            to each other in this world than there are things 'adapted';
            infinitely more things with irregular relations than with regular
            relations between them. But we look for the regular kind of thing
            exclusively, and ingeniously discover and preserve it in our
            memory. It accumulates with other regular kinds, until the
            collection of them fills our encyclopædias. Yet all the while
            between and around them lies an infinite anonymous chaos of
            objects that no one ever thought of together, of relations that
            never yet attracted our attention.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The facts of
            order from which the physico-theological argument starts are thus
            easily susceptible of interpretation as arbitrary human products.
            So long as this is the case, although of course no argument
            against God follows, it follows that the argument for him will
            fail to constitute a knock-down proof of his existence. It will
            be convincing only to those who on other grounds believe in him
            already.</p>

          pure logic? Theology herself has largely based this doctrine upon
          revelation; and, in discussing it, has tended more and more to
          substitute conventional ideas of criminal law for a priori
          principles of reason. But the very notion that this glorious
          universe, with planets and winds, and laughing sky and ocean,

            Josiah Royce, in his Religious Aspect of Philosophy, Boston,
            1885; in his Conception of God, New York and London, 1897; and
            lately in his Aberdeen Gifford Lectures, The World and the

            seem to some of my readers to evade the philosophic duty which my
            thesis in this lecture imposes on me, by not even attempting to
            meet Professor Royce's arguments articulately. I admit the
            momentary evasion. In the present lectures, which are cast
            throughout in a popular mould, there seemed no room for subtle
            metaphysical discussion, and for tactical purposes it was
            sufficient, the contention of philosophy being what it is
            (namely, that religion can be transformed into a universally
            convincing science), to point to the fact that no religious
            philosophy has actually convinced the mass of thinkers. Meanwhile
            let me say that I hope that the present volume may be followed by
            another, if I am spared to write it, in which not only Professor
            Royce's arguments, but others for monistic absolutism shall be

            importance calls for. At present I resign myself to lying passive

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I cannot
            resist the temptation of quoting an expression of an even more
            primitive style of religious thought, which I find in Arber's
            English Garland, vol. vii. p. 440. Robert Lyde, an English
            sailor, along with an English boy, being prisoners on a French
            ship in 1689, set upon the crew, of seven Frenchmen, killed two,
            made the other five prisoners, and brought home the ship. Lyde
            thus describes how in this feat he found his God a very present
            help in time of trouble:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“With the assistance of God I kept my feet when they
            three and one more did strive to throw me down. Feeling the
            Frenchman which hung about my middle hang very heavy, I said to
            the boy, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Go round the binnacle, and
            knock down that man that hangeth on my back.’</span> So the boy
            did strike him one blow on the head which made him fall.... Then
            I looked about for a marlin spike or anything else to strike them
            withal. But seeing nothing, I said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord!</span></span> what shall I
            do?’</span> Then casting up my eye upon my left side, and seeing
            a marlin spike hanging, I jerked my right arm and took hold, and
            struck the point four times about a quarter of an inch deep into
            the skull of that man that had hold of my left arm. [One of the
            Frenchmen then hauled the marlin spike away from him.] But
            through <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's</span></span> wonderful
            providence! it either fell out of his hand, or else he threw it
            down, and at this time the Almighty <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> gave me strength
            enough to take one man in one hand, and throw at the other's
            head: and looking about again to see anything to strike them
            withal, but seeing nothing, I said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord!</span></span> what shall I do
            now?’</span> And then it pleased <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> to put me in mind of
            my knife in my pocket. And although two of the men had hold of my
            right arm, yet <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> Almighty
            strengthened me so that I put my right hand into my right pocket,
            drew out the knife and sheath, ... put it between my legs and
            drew it out, and then cut the man's throat with it that had his
            back to my breast: and he immediately dropt down, and scarce ever
            stirred after.”</span>—I have slightly abridged Lyde's

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">A friend of mine, a first-rate
          psychologist, who is a subject of graphic automatism, tells me that
          the appearance of independent actuation in the movements of his
          arm, when he writes automatically, is so distinct that it obliges
          him to abandon a psychophysical theory which he had previously
          believed in, the theory, namely, that we have no feeling of the
          discharge downwards of our voluntary motor-centres. We must
          normally have such a feeling, he thinks, or the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sense of an
          absence</span></em> would not be so striking as it is in these
          experiences. Graphic automatism of a fully developed kind is rare

          shown by the context to indicate inspiration rather than directly
          automatic writing. In some eccentric sects this latter occurs. The
          most striking instance of it is probably the bulky volume called,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It may be very interesting for you to know that the
            President [Mr. Snow] of the Mormon Church claims to have had a

            what these revelations are, it is necessary to know that we, as a
            people, believe that the Church of Jesus Christ has again been
            established through messengers sent from heaven. This Church has
            at its head a prophet, seer, and revelator, who gives to man
            God's holy will. Revelation is the means through which the will
            of God is declared directly and in fullness to man. These
            revelations are got through dreams of sleep or in waking visions
            of the mind, by voices without visional appearance, or by actual
            manifestations of the Holy Presence before the eye. We believe
            that God has come in person and spoken to our prophet and
            revelator.”</span></p>

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">From this point of view, the contrasts
          between the healthy and the morbid mind, and between the once-born
          and the twice-born types, of which I spoke in earlier lectures (see
          pp. <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Pg162">162-167</a>), cease to be
          the radical antagonisms which many think them. The twice-born look
          down upon the rectilinear consciousness of life of the once-born as
          being <span class="tei tei-q">“mere morality,”</span> and not
          properly religion. <span class="tei tei-q">“Dr. Channing,”</span>
          an orthodox minister is reported to have said, <span class="tei tei-q">“is excluded from the highest form of religious life by
          the extraordinary rectitude of his character.”</span> It is indeed
          true that the outlook upon life of the twice-born—holding as it
          does more of the element of evil in solution—is the wider and
          completer. The <span class="tei tei-q">“heroic”</span> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“solemn”</span> way in which life comes to
          them is a <span class="tei tei-q">“higher synthesis”</span> into
          which healthy-mindedness and morbidness both enter and combine.
          Evil is not evaded, but sublated in the higher religious cheer of
          these persons (see pp. <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Pg047">47-52</a>, <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Pg362">362-365</a>). But the final consciousness which each
          type reaches of union with the divine has the same practical
          significance for the individual; and individuals may well be
          allowed to get to it by the channels which lie most open to their
          several temperaments. In the cases which were quoted in Lecture IV,
          of the mind-cure form of healthy-mindedness, we found abundant
          examples of regenerative process. The severity of the crisis in
          this process is a matter of degree. How long one shall continue to
          drink the consciousness of evil, and when one shall begin to
          short-circuit and get rid of it, are also matters of amount and
          degree, so that in many instances it is quite arbitrary whether we
          class the individual as a once-born or a twice-born subject.</dd>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We see that God has created the sun to keep the
            changeable conditions on the earth in such an order that living

            the most reasonable of creatures, and able to infer God's
            invisible being from the contemplation of the world, the sun in
            so far forth contributes to the primary purpose of creation:
            without it the race of man could not be preserved or
            continued.... The sun makes daylight, not only on our earth, but
            also on the other planets; and daylight is of the utmost utility
            to us; for by its means we can commodiously carry on those
            occupations which in the night-time would either be quite
            impossible, or at any rate impossible without our going to the
            expense of artificial light. The beasts of the field can find
            food by day which they would not be able to find at night.
            Moreover we owe it to the sunlight that we are able to see
            everything that is on the earth's surface, not only near by, but
            also at a distance, and to recognize both near and far things
            according to their species, which again is of manifold use to us
            not only in the business necessary to human life, and when we are
            traveling, but also for the scientific knowledge of Nature, which
            knowledge for the most part depends on observations made with the
            help of sight, and, without the sunshine, would have been
            impossible. If any one would rightly impress on his mind the
            great advantages which he derives from the sun, let him imagine
            himself living through only one month, and see how it would be
            with all his undertakings, if it were not day but night. He would
            then be sufficiently convinced out of his own experience,
            especially if he had much work to carry on in the street or in
            the fields.... From the sun we learn to recognize when it is
            midday, and by knowing this point of time exactly, we can set our
            clocks right, on which account astronomy owes much to the sun....
            By help of the sun one can find the meridian.... But the meridian
            is the basis of our sun-dials, and generally speaking, we should
            have no sun-dials if we had no sun.”</span> Vernünftige Gedanken

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Or read the
            account of God's beneficence in the institution of <span class="tei tei-q">“the great variety throughout the world of men's
            faces, voices, and handwriting,”</span> given in Derham's
            Physico-theology, a book that had much vogue in the eighteenth
            century. <span class="tei tei-q">“Had Man's body,”</span> says
            Dr. Derham, <span class="tei tei-q">“been made according to any
            of the Atheistical Schemes, or any other Method than that of the
            infinite Lord of the World, this wise Variety would never have
            been: but Men's Faces would have been cast in the same, or not a
            very different Mould, their Organs of Speech would have sounded
            the same or not so great a Variety of Notes; and the same
            Structure of Muscles and Nerves would have given the Hand the
            same Direction in Writing. And in this Case, what Confusion, what
            Disturbance, what Mischiefs would the world eternally have lain
            under! No Security could have been to our persons; no Certainty,
            no Enjoyment of our Possessions; no Justice between Man and Man;
            no Distinction between Good and Bad, between Friends and Foes,
            between Father and Child, Husband and Wife, Male or Female; but
            all would have been turned topsy-turvy, by being exposed to the
            Malice of the Envious and ill-Natured, to the Fraud and Violence
            of Knaves and Robbers, to the Forgeries of the crafty Cheat, to
            the Lusts of the Effeminate and Debauched, and what not! Our
            Courts of Justice can abundantly testify the dire Effects of
            Mistaking Men's Faces, of counterfeiting their Hands, and forging
            Writings. But now as the infinitely wise Creator and Ruler hath
            ordered the Matter, every man's Face can distinguish him in the
            Light, and his Voice in the Dark; his Hand-writing can speak for
            him though absent, and be his Witness, and secure his Contracts
            in future Generations. A manifest as well as admirable Indication
            of the divine Superintendence and Management.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A God so
            careful as to make provision even for the unmistakable signing of
            bank checks and deeds was a deity truly after the heart of
            eighteenth century Anglicanism.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I subjoin,
            omitting the capitals, Derham's <span class="tei tei-q">“Vindication of God by the Institution of Hills and
            Valleys,”</span> and Wolff's altogether culinary account of the
            institution of Water:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The uses,”</span> says Wolff, <span class="tei tei-q">“which water serves in human life are plain to see
            and need not be described at length. Water is a universal drink
            of man and beasts. Even though men have made themselves drinks
            that are artificial, they could not do this without water. Beer
            is brewed of water and malt, and it is the water in it which
            quenches thirst. Wine is prepared from grapes, which could never
            have grown without the help of water; and the same is true of
            those drinks which in England and other places they produce from
            fruit.... Therefore since God so planned the world that men and
            beasts should live upon it and find there everything required for
            their necessity and convenience, he also made water as one means
            whereby to make the earth into so excellent a dwelling. And this
            is all the more manifest when we consider the advantages which we
            obtain from this same water for the cleaning of our household
            utensils, of our clothing, and of other matters.... When one goes
            into a grinding-mill one sees that the grindstone must always be
            kept wet and then one will get a still greater idea of the use of
            water.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the hills
            and valleys, Derham, after praising their beauty, discourses as
            follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“Some constitutions are indeed
            of so happy a strength, and so confirmed an health, as to be
            indifferent to almost any place or temperature of the air. But
            then others are so weakly and feeble, as not to be able to bear
            one, but can live comfortably in another place. With some the
            more subtle and finer air of the hills doth best agree, who are
            languishing and dying in the feculent and grosser air of great
            towns, or even the warmer and vaporous air of the valleys and
            waters. But contrariwise, others languish on the hills, and grow
            lusty and strong in the warmer air of the valleys.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“So that this opportunity of shifting our abode from
            the hills to the vales, is an admirable easement, refreshment,
            and great benefit to the valetudinarian, feeble part of mankind;
            affording those an easy and comfortable life, who would otherwise
            live miserably, languish, and pine away.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“To this salutary conformation of the earth we may
            add another great convenience of the hills, and that is affording
            commodious places for habitation, serving (as an eminent author
            wordeth it) as screens to keep off the cold and nipping blasts of
            the northern and easterly winds, and reflecting the benign and
            cherishing sunbeams, and so rendering our habitations both more
            comfortable and more cheerly in winter.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Lastly, it is to the hills that the fountains owe
            their rise and the rivers their conveyance, and consequently
            those vast masses and lofty piles are not, as they are charged,
            such rude and useless excrescences of our ill-formed globe; but
            the admirable tools of nature, contrived and ordered by the
            infinite Creator, to do one of its most useful works. For, was
            the surface of the earth even and level, and the middle parts of
            its islands and continents not mountainous and high as now it is,
            it is most certain there could be no descent for the rivers, no
            conveyance for the waters; but, instead of gliding along those
            gentle declivities which the higher lands now afford them quite
            down to the sea, they would stagnate and perhaps stink, and also
            drown large tracts of land.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“[Thus] the hills and vales, though to a peevish and
            weary traveler they may seem incommodious and troublesome, yet
            are a noble work of the great Creator, and wisely appointed by
            him for the good of our sublunary world.”</span></p>

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Until the
            seventeenth century this mode of thought prevailed. One need only
            recall the dramatic treatment even of mechanical questions by
            Aristotle, as, for example, his explanation of the power of the
            lever to make a small weight raise a larger one. This is due,
            according to Aristotle, to the generally miraculous character of
            the circle and of all circular movement. The circle is both
            convex and concave; it is made by a fixed point and a moving
            line, which contradict each other; and whatever moves in a circle
            moves in opposite directions. Nevertheless, movement in a circle
            is the most <span class="tei tei-q">“natural”</span> movement;
            and the long arm of the lever, moving, as it does, in the larger
            circle, has the greater amount of this natural motion, and
            consequently requires the lesser force. Or recall the explanation
            by Herodotus of the position of the sun in winter: It moves to
            the south because of the cold which drives it into the warm parts
            of the heavens over Libya. Or listen to Saint Augustine's
            speculations: <span class="tei tei-q">“Who gave to chaff such
            power to freeze that it preserves snow buried under it, and such
            power to warm that it ripens green fruit? Who can explain the
            strange properties of fire itself, which blackens all that it
            burns, though itself bright, and which, though of the most
            beautiful colors, discolors almost all that it touches and feeds
            upon, and turns blazing fuel into grimy cinders?... Then what
            wonderful properties do we find in charcoal, which is so brittle
            that a light tap breaks it, and a slight pressure pulverizes it,
            and yet is so strong that no moisture rots it, nor any time
            causes it to decay.”</span> City of God, book xxi. ch. iv.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such aspects
            of things as these, their naturalness and unnaturalness, the
            sympathies and antipathies of their superficial qualities, their
            eccentricities, their brightness and strength and
            destructiveness, were inevitably the ways in which they
            originally fastened our attention.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If you open
            early medical books, you will find sympathetic magic invoked on
            every page. Take, for example, the famous vulnerary ointment
            attributed to Paracelsus. For this there were a variety of
            receipts, including usually human fat, the fat of either a bull,
            a wild boar, or a bear; powdered earthworms, the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">usnia</span></span>, or mossy growth on the
            weathered skull of a hanged criminal, and other materials equally
            unpleasant—the whole prepared under the planet Venus if possible,
            but never under Mars or Saturn. Then, if a splinter of wood,
            dipped in the patient's blood, or the bloodstained weapon that
            wounded him, be immersed in this ointment, the wound itself being
            tightly bound up, the latter infallibly gets well,—I quote now
            Van Helmont's account,—for the blood on the weapon or splinter,
            containing in it the spirit of the wounded man, is roused to
            active excitement by the contact of the ointment, whence there
            results to it a full commission or power to cure its
            cousin-german, the blood in the patient's body. This it does by
            sucking out the dolorous and exotic impression from the wounded
            part. But to do this it has to implore the aid of the bull's fat,
            and other portions of the unguent. The reason why bull's fat is
            so powerful is that the bull at the time of slaughter is full of
            secret reluctancy and vindictive murmurs, and therefore dies with
            a higher flame of revenge about him than any other animal. And
            thus we have made it out, says this author, that the admirable
            efficacy of the ointment ought to be imputed, not to any
            auxiliary concurrence of Satan, but simply to the energy of the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">posthumous character of Revenge</span></em>
            remaining firmly impressed upon the blood and concreted fat in
            the unguent. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">J. B. Van Helmont</span></span>: A
            Ternary of Paradoxes, translated by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Walter

            original in my citations.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The author
            goes on to prove by the analogy of many other natural facts that
            this sympathetic action between things at a distance is the true
            rationale of the case. <span class="tei tei-q">“If,”</span> he
            says, <span class="tei tei-q">“the heart of a horse, slain by a
            witch, taken out of the yet reeking carcase, be impaled upon an
            arrow and roasted, immediately the whole witch becomes tormented
            with the insufferable pains and cruelty of the fire, which could
            by no means happen unless there preceded a conjunction of the
            spirit of the witch with the spirit of the horse. In the reeking
            and yet panting heart, the spirit of the witch is kept captive,
            and the retreat of it prevented by the arrow transfixed.
            Similarly hath not many a murdered carcase at the coroner's
            inquest suffered a fresh hæmorrhage or cruentation at the
            presence of the assassin?—the blood being, as in a furious fit of
            anger, enraged and agitated by the impress of revenge conceived
            against the murderer, at the instant of the soul's compulsive
            exile from the body. So, if you have dropsy, gout, or jaundice,
            by including some of your warm blood in the shell and white of an
            egg, which, exposed to a gentle heat, and mixed with a bait of
            flesh, you shall give to a hungry dog or hog, the disease shall
            instantly pass from you into the animal, and leave you entirely.
            And similarly again, if you burn some of the milk either of a cow
            or of a woman, the gland from which it issued will dry up. A
            gentleman at Brussels had his nose mowed off in a combat, but the
            celebrated surgeon Tagliacozzus digged a new nose for him out of
            the skin of the arm of a porter at Bologna. About thirteen months
            after his return to his own country, the engrafted nose grew
            cold, putrefied, and in a few days dropped off, and it was then
            discovered that the porter had expired, near about the same
            punctilio of time. There are still at Brussels eye-witnesses of
            this occurrence,”</span> says Van Helmont; and adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“I pray what is there in this of superstition or of
            exalted imagination?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even the
            errors of fact may possibly turn out not to be as wholesale as
            the scientist assumes. We saw in Lecture IV how the religious
            conception of the universe seems to many mind-curers 'verified'
            from day to day by their experience of fact. <span class="tei tei-q">“Experience of fact”</span> is a field with so many
            things in it that the sectarian scientist, methodically
            declining, as he does, to recognize such <span class="tei tei-q">“facts”</span> as mind-curers and others like them
            experience, otherwise than by such rude heads of classification
            as <span class="tei tei-q">“bosh,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“rot,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“folly,”</span>
            certainly leaves out a mass of raw fact which, save for the
            industrious interest of the religious in the more personal
            aspects of reality, would never have succeeded in getting itself
            recorded at all. We know this to be true already in certain
            cases; it may, therefore, be true in others as well. Miraculous
            healings have always been part of the supernaturalist stock in
            trade, and have always been dismissed by the scientist as
            figments of the imagination. But the scientist's tardy education
            in the facts of hypnotism has recently given him an apperceiving
            mass for phenomena of this order, and he consequently now allows
            that the healings may exist, provided you expressly call them
            effects of <span class="tei tei-q">“suggestion.”</span> Even the
            stigmata of the cross on Saint Francis's hands and feet may on
            these terms not be a fable. Similarly, the time-honored
            phenomenon of diabolical possession is on the point of being
            admitted by the scientist as a fact, now that he has the name of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“hystero-demonopathy”</span> by which to
            apperceive it. No one can foresee just how far this legitimation
            of occultist phenomena under newly found scientist titles may
            proceed—even <span class="tei tei-q">“prophecy,”</span> even
            <span class="tei tei-q">“levitation,”</span> might creep into the
            pale.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the
            divorce between scientist facts and religious facts may not
            necessarily be as eternal as it at first sight seems, nor the
            personalism and romanticism of the world, as they appeared to
            primitive thinking, be matters so irrevocably outgrown. The final
            human opinion may, in short, in some manner now impossible to
            foresee, revert to the more personal style, just as any path of
            progress may follow a spiral rather than a straight line. If this
            were so, the rigorously impersonal view of science might one day
            appear as having been a temporarily useful eccentricity rather
            than the definitively triumphant position which the sectarian
            scientist at present so confidently announces it to be.</p>

            martyrs have sung in the flames for a mere inference, however
            inevitable it might be? Original religious men, like Saint
            Francis, Luther, Behmen, have usually been enemies of the
            intellect's pretension to meddle with religious things. Yet the
            intellect, everywhere invasive, shows everywhere its shallowing
            effect. See how the ancient spirit of Methodism evaporates under
            those wonderfully able rationalistic booklets (which every one
            should read) of a philosopher like Professor Bowne (The Christian
            Revelation, The Christian Life, The Atonement: Cincinnati and New
            York, 1898, 1899, 1900). See the positively expulsive purpose of
            philosophy properly so called:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Religion,”</span> writes M. Vacherot (La Religion,
            Paris, 1869, pp. 313, 436, et passim), <span class="tei tei-q">“answers to a transient state or condition, not to a
            permanent determination of human nature, being merely an
            expression of that stage of the human mind which is dominated by
            the imagination.... Christianity has but a single possible final
            heir to its estate, and that is scientific
            philosophy.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a still
            more radical vein, Professor Ribot (Psychologie des Sentiments,
            p. 310) describes the evaporation of religion. He sums it up in a
            single formula—the ever-growing predominance of the rational
            intellectual element, with the gradual fading out of the
            emotional element, this latter tending to enter into the group of
            purely intellectual sentiments. <span class="tei tei-q">“Of
            religious sentiment properly so called, nothing survives at last
            save a vague respect for the unknowable <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">x</span></span>
            which is a last relic of the fear, and a certain attraction
            towards the ideal, which is a relic of the love, that
            characterized the earlier periods of religious growth. To state
            this more simply, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">religion tends to turn into religious
            philosophy</span></em>.—These are psychologically entirely
            different things, the one being a theoretic construction of
            ratiocination, whereas the other is the living work of a group of
            persons, or of a great inspired leader, calling into play the
            entire thinking and feeling organism of man.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I find the
            same failure to recognize that the stronghold of religion lies in
            individuality in attempts like those of Professor Baldwin (Mental
            Development, Social and Ethical Interpretations, ch. x.) and Mr.
            H. R. Marshall (Instinct and Reason, chaps, viii. to xii.) to
            make it a purely <span class="tei tei-q">“conservative social
            force.”</span></p>

            nature, build up yourselves, the effulgent, the resplendent, the

            reinforce the impression on the reader's mind:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Man can learn to transcend these limitations [of
            finite thought] and draw power and wisdom at will.... The divine
            presence is known through experience. The turning to a higher
            plane is a distinct act of consciousness. It is not a vague,
            twilight or semi-conscious experience. It is not an ecstasy; it
            is not a trance. It is not super-consciousness in the Vedantic
            sense. It is not due to self-hypnotization. It is a perfectly
            calm, sane, sound, rational, common-sense shifting of
            consciousness from the phenomena of sense-perception to the
            phenomena of seership, from the thought of self to a
            distinctively higher realm.... For example, if the lower self be
            nervous, anxious, tense, one can in a few moments compel it to be
            calm. This is not done by a word simply. Again I say, it is not
            hypnotism. It is by the exercise of power. One feels the spirit
            of peace as definitely as heat is perceived on a hot summer day.
            The power can be as surely used as the sun's rays can be focused
            and made to do work, to set fire to wood.”</span> The Higher Law,

          world, setting in at single points. Our difficulties and our ideals
          are all piecemeal affairs, but the Absolute can do no piecework for
          us; so that all the interests which our poor souls compass raise
          their heads too late. We should have spoken earlier, prayed for
          another world absolutely, before this world was born. It is
          strange, I have heard a friend say, to see this blind corner into
          which Christian thought has worked itself at last, with its God who
          can raise no particular weight whatever, who can help us with no
          private burden, and who is on the side of our enemies as much as he
          is on our own. Odd evolution from the God of David's psalms!</dd>
